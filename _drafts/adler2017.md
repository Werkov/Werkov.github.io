## Day 1

- Choceň -- the station is a lie
- Opočno
  - finally I saw dried milk factory
  - pictersque nooks, in neihborhood of castle
  - main square is a bus station, seemed not so lively
- uncomfortable walk to Dobruška along 2nd class road (I saw a pile of sugar beet)
- Dobruška
  - lively square (people going to offices, authorities, bank, lunch, ...)
  - granite rotating sphere in water fountain, same as in Vlašim -- who does that?
  - lunch in Asian bistro -- compared to Prague, less rush, more community
    (even a policeman came to order)
  - but: behind old town houses a block of (concrete) flats
- hiking path
  - first villages, then individual houses (nice living in "forests"), then only huts
  - reminds Czech-Moravian Highlands a bit
- gradually appearing snow (but still sudden at ~2 km scale)
- fog, very much (and thus perspiration)
- Deštné was dark, foggy and deserted (at 4 PM)

## Day 2

- sunny morning, I set off at 9 AM (instead of planned 8 AM due to fear of cold)
- I walked up to the Šerlich pass, saw some bunkers (řopík)
- interesting effect -- observing fog of my breath
  - normally there was only little fog
  - after passing a car it was much denser
  - why?
  - water vapor in car exhalations? mixing colder/moist air from forest with
    hotter/dryer above road
- when I entered ridge path I saw it'd be better to have cross-country skis (or
  snowshoes actually)
  - after ~8 km of sinking into deep snow along cross-country ski tracks I was
    bit frustrated
- the Deštná peak is not much interesting (no outlook) and the way on the ridge
  was slightly windy
- at the end I ran down a ski slope
- in contrast with web advertising, almost none of the accommodation was open at the time of year
- only the hotel, with ~3 times greater price than the other (expected) -- I
  was the only guest, the receptionist and waiter had to stay because of me,
  I've felt like I was buying their loyalty
  - and cat has partially eaten my supplies (stuff I cooled on balcony)

## Day 3

- morning started sunny but then came fog and clouds (even before I departed, 9 AM)
- I went through Julinčino(?) valley, there was still snow but around
  550--600 m snow disappeared gradually
- extremely ugly railway station in Rokytnice v OH (ruin of former barracks)
- I drowned in mud and got lost a bit in the forests, then I got to fields
  where it was subjectively much colder than on the ridge, perhaps because of
  the wind and fog
- lunch in Žamberk and nice and quite large castle park (which continuously
  transforms to forests/fields out of the town)
- Lukavice -- extremely long village
- also by registration plates of local cars I could notice I passed the border
  of regions (HK->Pdbice)
- Letohrad castle with park, outlook and private grammar school
- I waited for a train to Brno more than 1.25 hour in Česká Třebová
  - on 1st railway corridor(!) -- I only had Czech Railways ticket (not RegioJet)

## TODO lessons learnt
- snowshoes
- announce/arrange accommodation in advance
- winter sleeping bag+mattress?
- (snow) leg cuffs?
- functional underwear (T-shirt, underpants)
