title: "Thesis fail"

## Purpose of the post and timeline

Despite, it's quite personal to me, I think that others may learn from my
errors and those are mostly general statements that doesn't uncover any
sensitive information about myself.
At least my future me can learn and maybe others may learn about my perception.

  * 2014 Oct -- started research, topic was quite new to me
  * 2014 Nov--2015 Jan -- first ideas, learnt internals to design it better
  * 2015 Feb--2015 Mar -- spending time on another project -- mistake
  * 2015 Apr--2015 May -- actual implementation, slower than expected
  * 2015 Jun -- studying and passing final exams, initiating thesis text,
    researching deeper and being disappointed by misdirection of my previous
    research and its effect of design
  * 2015 Jul -- the month I could finish if I fought, but I failed instead (and
    this text should analyze and rationalize reasons for that)

The following text is partitioned into three parts:

  * [general observations](#gen) -- personally perceived wisdoms that might be
    generally useful,
  * [personal](#personal) -- list of my feelings, for future reference,
  * [outer perception](#outer) -- what I think is importat from other people's point of
    view.

## General observations
<a name="gen"></a>

### Interrupts are hard to recover

Any pause due to other activities or even taking a rest to get a fresh view
cause context loss, that is hard to recover, i.e. continuation requires greater
effort than uninterrupted work.


### Bad feelings amplification

Aka [positive feedback][ps] with negative consequences.
You didn't work sufficiently, you feel bad, it decreases your performace so you
don't work sufficiently.

[ps]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback

### Permanent offset

Once you wake up late, you feel bad you lost your day (e.g. whole forenoon),
it invalidates your attempts to work.
You then can't fall asleep -- no sleep of the righteous man.
Instead of using insomnia time for work, you fill it
with [cheap joys](#cheap-joys).

### Frustration leads to cheap joys
<a name="cheap-joys"></a>

Once you are not satisfied with results of your work,
you begin to feel [sad][dop].
To compensate for this, you start looking for joys that are accessible with
less effort (YouTube, forums, food etc.).

[dop]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine

### Not working gives you time to think negatively

When you don't work, your mind is not occupied by solving a particular problem.
Instead, the mind is free to start thinking negatively and nurture a bad mood.

### Block-all paradox

Effectively, you are prevented from doing anything useful.
You don't work on the thesis, since you are blocked by the futility.
On the other hand, you don't work on anything else neither, since you should be
working on the thesis, right?

### Be honestly humble, earthbound

Having big expectations is nice when fantasizing,
however, it can be destructing when you realize you can't achieve those goals.

### Thesis == documentation

I haven't heard about a programmer that would like to write a documentation.
I'm not a scientist, my thesis needn't to communicate great/novel research
ideas to others (at least on some level).
Thesis thus seems like just an addendum to the code that inherently bears the
ideas itself.

### Home office sucks

For most of my live, I've done useful work at other places than home (school,
work).
At home, I mostly relaxed and did meta-activities (food preparation, tidying, etc.).
This grew a conditional reflex in my mind: you are at home, you don't work.

Similar goes for hot weather (I usually spend summers out of school, doing my
hobbies, not duties).

### The longer, the better
<a name="longer"></a>

Also another case of a conditional reflex/false deduction.
Everything cool you've done so far took you not negligible amount of time.
However, the reverse is not true -- it needn't to take long to be great.
Thus you figuratively burn your time for illusion, it'll result in greater good.

### Overengineering diffusion

The more robust and general system you want to design,
the more factors you have to take into account.
Naturally, it's not possible to predict results of all design decisions in
advance, thus it leads to doubts about everything and hesitating with actions.

See [the prompts](http://kevinlawler.com/prompts) and [The Zen of
Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/).

### Deadline singularity

It's a widely known, that deadlines increase productivity.  With tongue in the
cheek, your instantaneous productivity attains infinity right at the moment of
the deadline.

Without intermediate deadlines, you can always find something with higher
priority or try spending time on the best possible solution.

## Personal
<a name="personal"></a>

Here are some more personal/internal feelings.

  * Lack of faith -- self-confidence and thesis project in general.
  * Not persuaded that I can finish it during the month.
  * Probably internally gave up at the end of June.
  * Accepted the defeat -- unblocked and could start work again.
  * I was waiting for a start of new (professional) job. Not feeling that bad
    about doing nothing and looking forward for the end of the struggle.
  * Everyone knows everyone, I feared having a bad reputation for poor result
    (not the thesis, the code).


## Outer perception
<a name="outer"></a>

This is probably, how I'll be looked at (and how I'd used to look at people
prior my experience).

  * Lack of will.
  * Lack of motivation.
  * Laziness.
  * Advice: Give a shit, be pragmatic, get a degree.
