## Diary

- night train
- Serbia
- Sofia
- Rila
- Pirin
- bus back

## Practicals

- medium comfort in Serbian sleeping carriage (with smokers)
- very slow (<40 km/h) Serbian railway (and no guarantee on (seat) reservations)
- very long waiting on (Schengen area) borders (both directions)
- European level hostel in Sofia (TODO link)
- limited supply of water while climbing Musala
  - crazy Bulgarian gifted us a bottle of water
- descent is harder than climbing (also depends on tightening the boots)
  - down to Makedonija was the worst
  - later tried sandals on grassy surfaces
- nondistinctive/obsoleted marking of the hiking route on descent to Predel
- various intensity of sweating + demi/dehy effect on power and strength

## Natural sights

- canyon from Serbia to "Bulgaria" (TODO map check)
- horses 
  - in cities (workhorses)
  - in mountains (wild?)
- Musala (hihghet peak of Balkans)
  - up there is cold and windy
- landscape with green/brown grass and islands of dwarf pines
- many lakes (water systems in mountains?)
- pictersque sleeping by lakes above Makedonija
- relative sunset (occluded by mountains), brown mist on horizon


## Manmade sights

- seen Visegrad (from train)
- Serbian facades (none)
- Belgrade looks very poor (just neighborhood of railway station (which is
  quite small))
  - affected by migrating refugees? (Farsi/Arabic labels in park)
- Sofia
  - compact center 
  - no river in Sofia
  - orthodox church, mosque (open), synagogue (closed)
    - first time in mosque
    - tactile icons
- contrast: office buildings with cobble stone roads, housing estates,
  restaurants, wild dogs and horse-towed carriage
- Borovec, Bansko -- tourist crowded locations for skiing
- everything looks overengineered for much greater load (Musala hut, Granchar,...)
  - perhaps used earlier
  - camping in Predel

## People and society

- people smoke more in Balkan (cigarette ends even on mountain paths)
- contrast of EU/nonEU (nice Sofia arrival)
- (TODO annotate better) Bulgarian socioeconomic situation: 100, 300, 500 (pension, average salary, ???)
- Bulgarian symbol of lion (church, currency)
- not many marks of Turkish influence (cf. Czechia and Austria-Hungary)
- buses scaled to traffic (marshrootka?)
- meeting Czechs
  - experienced Alda
  - sharing experience
    - shoes
    - food (travel lunch)
    - maps
    - canyoning
  - Czech scouts, German group/tourists
- meeting Bulgarians
  - silent guide and his band
  - talkative attractive ecologist girl
  - sisters at Granchar hut
- low morale in misty/cold morning + sudden change after clearing the clouds
  - it's actually same in real life
- Bulgarian nodding (it's inverse!)

## Food

- traditional (TODO link) gyros in Budapest
- extra large tomatoes
- Schopska salad, bean soup

## Equipment

## Lessons learnt

## Random thoughts?

- distorted estimate of inclination


- Predel pronunciation
  - hut vs camping
  - shop by the road
  - spring of Ivan the Tshudotvorets
- animals at Javorov hut
  - cat, fox, hunter dogs
- sudden change from granite to lime
- Koncheto was packed with tourists and slightly dangerous (if one was dizzy or exhausted)
- climb to Vichren -- ferrata?
- descent to Banderitsa hut throurgh a field of large round limestones and grass + chamois
- long way back in luxurious bus
  - worst road surface was between Brno and Prague (and Sofia southern ring)
- clouds and interesting turbulent streams
- truck loaded with steel rods

- Turkish toilet
