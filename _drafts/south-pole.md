### Language & style

```
...big Emperor penguin, making bow after bow. It gave exactly the impression of
having come up simply to pay us its respects. We were sorry to repay its
attention so poorly, but such is the way of the world. With a final bow it
ended its days in the frying-pan.
```
```
came a crab-eater, shining like silver in the sun. He came right up, was photographed, and -- shot.
```
```
"An Emperor penguin just come on a visit -- soup-kettle." He did not get a very long epitaph.
```

* they employed bitches
* intermezzo with a 3rd person visits the hut
