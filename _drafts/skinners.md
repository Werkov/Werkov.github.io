asphalt
- beats up to head (most heavy impact on heels)

grass
- comfortable, but little cold

gravel
- slightly painfull when stepping on pointed/sharp stones

dusty path
- similar to grass, comfortable

size
- my regular size is upper end of the bought range so IÂ was afraid that it's small
- when I ran it was comfortable, larger size might be skidding on sweaty foot

self-conscious during first run

afterwards
- immediately I felt pulsation on bottom side of feet and little tiredness of ankles
