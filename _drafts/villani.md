  - how Bolzano read Euclid's Foundations and was cured
  - also A. Lincoln read Euclides

- Leather of Shallows (Challot)??
  - can see thing only through a mirror
- Riemann Hypothesis
  - [ilbert]
  - relation to prime numbers
  - and also eigenvector of matrix describing large atoms
  - in practice it's true (not proof, cf. physics, economics)
- how to become famous mathematician
  - prove great theorem
  - find great problem
  - find great concepts
    - Riemannian geometry
    - curvature
- hyperbolic stitching
  - constant negative curvature

- Francis Galton (if Greeks had known that law, they'd have personified it)
- Claude Channon
  - draft: information or uncertainity
  - rework by von Neuman: entropy
- entropy
  - number of combinations is out of this world, so logarithmize it
  - vacuum doesn't suck, it's power of statistics
  - Disorder and information is better than order and disinformation (about broadcasting company)
- partial differential equations
  - Navier-Stokes equations are popular in Holywood industry
- maximum entropy -- law of errors
  - a Boltzmann's equation for homogenous gas (is not homogenous)
- Cercignani Conjecture
  - Toscani, Villani
  - "Simple to state, difficult to prove. As you like it."
  - this idea was completely naïve and could never work but he found an
    interesting identity

  - book: The best uses of economic resources
  - operational research, plywood
    - linear programming used to be in French high school curriculum
  - Monge-Kantorovich
    - min-max flow theorem?
    - the theorem looks like maximization of capitalistic profit
- ..conclusion of topics..
  - prices (optimization)
  - shapes of triangles (geometry)
  - entropy (statistics)
- coworkers
  - Felix Otto, John Lott
  - visiting in USA, no duties, just goindǵ to lunch and socialize -- it cost him fortune
- the lazy gas experiment
  - initial and final state of gas
  - optimize way it transitions
  - simlar to movement in curved space
- Optimal transport, old and new (1000 pages book by him)
- new theorem every month
- importance of random encounters for research
