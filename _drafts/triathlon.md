- confusion what to do at start and where to deploy stuff
- appearenace change at swim start
- start is not important (arrow jump)
- great pressure at buoys (left turns)
- queueing at ladders out of water, are final strokes worth it?
- laces are great evil on cycling shoes
  - socks, yes or no?
- little stucked in cycling depo (fitting rubber band of starting number)
- heavy climb right at the begining
- I efefctively ignored the terrain attribute of this race
- narrow paths, Left!, Right! (left is more common)
- I saved energy for the next run part, despite that I was short of breath few times
  - I was drafting and later outrode the racers
- having a bottle on bicycle was a great plus
- second transition -- laces were mess I couldn't get off cycling shoes
  - OTOH, I could relax a bit more
- I took a wrong turn and lost ~10--20 seconds
- I was surprised by inclination of the terrain, although I could run sustainably
  - this hills training paid off
  - in running part I gained most of my position
- finish (and lap transitions) was very meandering
- I was euphoric about my final position (I did not find it that awesome later)
- lack of gargage bins/bags, little shaded locations, annoying moderator, confusion about swimming track at start, no beginner's instructions printed at place
- depo worked well, realtime performance displays (laps remaining, finishing position), SMS late

- I had a sore throat

TODO conditions:
- water temp 24°C
- air temp TODO
- warm, partly cloudy, no direct sunlight
