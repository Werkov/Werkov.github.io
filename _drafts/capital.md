### Preface

> The English Established Church, e.g., will more readily pardon an attack on
> 38 of its 39 articles than on 1/39 of its income.

### Part 1: Commodities and Money

#### Chapter 1: Commodities

> Lastly nothing can have value, without being an object of utility. If the
> thing is useless, so is the labour contained in it; the labour does not count
> as labour, and therefore creates no value.

- Mixing value and use value explained previously.

> Use values cannot confront each other as commodities, unless the useful
> labour embodied in them is qualitatively different in each of them.

> with reference to use value, the labour contained in a commodity counts only
> qualitatively, with reference to value it counts only quantitatively,

> labour, exercised during equal periods of time, always yields equal amounts
> of value. But it will yield, during equal periods of time, different
> quantities of values in use; more, if the productive power rise, fewer, if it
> fall.

> value can only manifest itself in the social relation of commodity to
> commodity.

> If the values of all commodities rose or fell simultaneously, and in the same
> proportion, their relative values would remain unaltered. Their real change
> of value would appear from the diminished or increased quantity of
> commodities produced in a given time.

- assumption of constant labour power

> The secret of the expression of value, namely, that all kinds of labour are
> equal and equivalent, because, and so far as they are human labour in
> general, cannot be deciphered, until the notion of human equality has already
> acquired the fixity of a popular prejudice.

> Weaving, which is the labour of certain private individuals producing a
> particular article, linen, acquires in consequence a social character, the
> character of equality with all other kinds of labour.

> Amongst the commodities which, in form B, figure as particular equivalents of
> the linen, and, in form C, express in common their relative values in linen,
> this foremost place has been attained by one in particular – namely, gold.

- This is obsolete now.

> labour of the individual asserts itself as a part of the labour of society,
> only by means of the relations which the act of exchange establishes directly
> between the products, and indirectly, through them, between the producers.

- IOW, without exchange, labour couldn't be stripped of quality.

> the product must be not only useful, but useful for others,
> [Robinson Crusoe ...] commences, like a true-born Briton, to keep a set of
> books.

> The tithe to be rendered to the priest is more matter of fact than his blessing.

- Church despect.

> So far no chemist has ever discovered exchange value either in a pearl or a
> diamond.

- Exchange value is just virtual.

> All commodities are non-use-values for their owners, and use-values for their
> non-owners.

- That's why exchange is (literally) useful.

> [“These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the
> beast.” Revelations, 17:13; “And that no man might buy or sell, save he that
> had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.”
> Revelations, 13:17.] (Apocalypse.)

- Even biblical quote (TODO remove?)

#### Chapter 2: Exchange

> In the last decades of the 17th century it had already been shown that money
> is a commodity,

#### Chapter 3: Money, Or the Circulation of Commodities

> It is not money that renders commodities commensurable. Just the contrary. It
> is because all commodities, as values, are realised human labour, and
> therefore commensurable,

- Importance of previous definition of "unified" labour.

> It is owing to this that, in all metallic currencies, the names given to the
> standards of money or of price were originally taken from the pre-existing
> names of the standards of weight.

- Interesting observation (pound, mark).

> Hence an object may have a price without having value. The price in that case
> is imaginary, like certain quantities in mathematics.

- Does he really mean imaginary numbers? Those are quite orthogonal to reals.


> the money in reality represents the quantity or sum of gold ideally expressed
> beforehand by the sum of the prices of the commodities.

- Gold standard superseded already.

> the quantity of money functioning as the circulating medium is equal to the
> sum of the prices of the commodities divided by the number of moves made by
> coins of the same denomination.

- More trading more money? This is inverse to the quoted relation.

> The erroneous opinion that it is, on the contrary, prices that are determined
> by the quantity of the circulating medium, and that the latter depends on the
> quantity of the precious metals in a country; this opinion was based by those
> who first held it, on the absurd hypothesis that commodities are without a
> price, and money without a value, when they first enter into circulation, and
> that, once in the circulation, an aliquot part of the medley of commodities
> is exchanged for an aliquot part of the heap of precious metals.

> It has its immediate origin in the metallic currency. Money based upon credit
> implies on the other hand conditions, which, from our standpoint of the
> simple circulation of commodities, are as yet totally unknown to us. But we
> may affirm this much, that just as true paper money takes its rise in the
> function of money as the circulating medium, so money based upon credit takes
> root spontaneously in the function of money as the means of payment.

> Commodities are thus sold not for the purpose of buying others, but in order
> to replace their commodity-form by their money-form.

> why Indian commodities are so cheap. Answer: Because the Hindus bury their money.

- He quotes Jacob Vanderlint.


> But money itself is a commodity, an external object, capable of becoming the
> private property of any individual. Thus social power becomes the private
> power of private persons. The ancients therefore denounced money as
> subversive of the economic and moral order of things.


### Part 2: Transformation of Money into Capital

#### Chapter 4: The General Formula for Capital

> If we abstract from the material substance of the circulation of commodities,
> that is, from the exchange of the various use-values, and consider only the
> economic forms produced by this process of circulation, we find its final
> result to be money: this final product of the circulation of commodities is
> the first form in which capital appears.

> different form: M-C-M, the transformation of money into commodities, and the
> change of commodities back again into money; or buying in order to sell.
> Money that circulates in the latter manner is thereby transformed into,
> becomes capital,

- Also compare money-power-money, power-money-power. I just think it's a phase
  shift.

> What, however, first and foremost distinguishes the circuit C-M-C from the
> circuit M-C-M, is the inverted order of succession of the two phases.

- What about the terminale phase of investing the money (M)/capital?

> The money, therefore, is not spent, it is merely advanced.

> The circuit C-M-C starts with one commodity, and finishes with another, which
> falls out of circulation and into consumption. Consumption, the satisfaction
> of wants, in one word, use-value, is its end and aim. The circuit M-C-M, on
> the contrary, commences with money and ends with money. Its leading motive,
> and the goal that attracts it, is therefore mere exchange-value.

- That's true but IMO they are just the same with dualism in place.

> As the conscious representative of this movement, the possessor of money
> becomes a capitalist. His person, or rather his pocket, is the point from
> which the money starts and to which it returns. The expansion of value, which
> is the objective basis or main-spring of the circulation M-C-M, becomes his
> subjective aim, and it is only in so far as the appropriation of ever more
> and more wealth in the abstract becomes the sole motive of his operations,
> that he functions as a capitalist, that is, as capital personified and
> endowed with consciousness and a will.

> The restless never-ending process of profit-making alone is what he aims at.

- I don't think this is clear from the previous argumentation.

> inwardly circumcised Jews,

#### Chapter 5: Contradictions in the General Formula of Capital

> “exchange is a transaction by which both sides gain.”

- Destutt de Tracy: “Traité de la Volonté et de ses effets.” Paris, 1826

> The value of a commodity is expressed in its price before it goes into
> circulation, and is therefore a precedent condition of circulation, not its
> result.

- That would be too rigid.

> The value of a thing consists solely in its relation to our wants.

- So let's condider use-value as market price where needs are the demand.

> “Commerce ... adds value to products, for the same products in the hands of
> consumers, are worth more than in the hands of producers,

- S. P. Newman: “Elements of Polit. Econ.” Andover and New York, 1835

> the upholders of the delusion that surplus-value has its origin in a nominal
> rise of prices or in the privilege which the seller has of selling too dear,
> must assume the existence of a class that only buys and does not sell, i.e.,
> only consumes and does not produce. The existence of such a class is
> inexplicable from the standpoint we have so far reached, viz., that of simple
> circulation.

- Simple circulation = conservation of value (the labour based)?

> The sum of the values in circulation can clearly not be augmented by any
> change in their distribution, any more than the quantity of the precious
> metals in a country by a Jew selling a Queen Anne’s farthing for a guinea.


> Turn and twist then as we may, the fact remains unaltered. If equivalents are
> exchanged, no surplus-value results, and if non-equivalents are exchanged,
> still no surplus-value.

- ???

#### Chapter 6: The Buying and Selling of Labour-Power


> Moneybags, must be so lucky as to find, within the sphere of circulation, in
> the market, a commodity, whose use-value possesses the peculiar property of
> being a source of value, whose actual consumption, therefore, is itself an
> embodiment of labour, and, consequently, a creation of value.

> The historical conditions of its existence are by no means given with the
> mere circulation of money and commodities. It can spring into life, only when
> the owner of the means of production and subsistence meets in the market with
> the free labourer selling his labour-power.

> In contradistinction therefore to the case of other commodities, there enters into the determination of the value of labour-power a historical and moral element.

> If his capacity for labour remains unsold, the labourer derives no benefit
> from it,
- wait, the labourer can cretate use-values for themselves, cant they?

> Its [labour power] value, like that of every other commodity, is already
> fixed before it goes into circulation, since a definite quantity of social
> labour has been spent upon it;

- by that rationale all wages should be equal in the same cultural and social
  context


### Part 3: The Production of Absolute Surplus-Value

#### Chapter 7: The Labour-Process and the Process of Producing Surplus-Value

> expend it on something useful, on something capable of satisfying a want of
> some sort.

> Franklin therefore defines man as a tool-making animal.

> The distinction between principal substance and accessory vanishes in the
> true chemical industries, because there none of the raw material re-appears,
> in its original composition, in the substance of the product.
- The idea of analyse is so naive, it admittedly stops working for chemical
  industry already.


> A machine which does not serve the purposes of labour, is useless.

- What a strong statement without any introductory context.

> The product, therefore, of individual consumption, is the consumer himself;
> the result of productive consumption, is a product distinct from the
> consumer.

> With the keen eye of an expert, he has selected the means of production and
> the kind of labour-power best adapted to his particular trade,

- The capitalist also spent his labour power

> Though the capitalist have a hobby, and use a gold instead of a steel spindle,


> But the sum of the values of the commodities that entered into the process
> amounts to 27 shillings. The value of the yarn is 30 shillings.
- how does he determine value of the yarn? shouldn't it be based on the labour
  expended + value of input commodities? I don't see the surplus value 

> labour-power whose production has cost more time and labour, and which
> therefore has a higher value, than unskilled or simple labour-power. This
> power being higher-value, its consumption is labour of a higher class, labour
> that creates in equal times proportionally higher values than unskilled
> labour does.
- So no vaverage social labour that would determine value , labour-based value
  is ill-defined.


#### Chapter 8: Constant Capital and Variable Capital

> Therefore, the means of production can never add more value to the product
> than they themselves possess independently of the process in which they
> assist.

#### Chapter 9: The Rate of Surplus-Value

> But in truth, the rate of surplus-value is not equal to s/C or s/(c+v), but
> to s/v: thus it is not 90/500 but 90/90 or 100%, which is more than five
> times the apparent degree of exploitation.

> And the Professor calls this an “analysis!”
- Mocking a scholar (he is actually right on that point).

> Now, gentlemen, if you compare the working-time you pay for,
- calling persons

#### Chapter 10: The Working day

> You preach to me constantly the gospel of “saving” and “abstinence.” Good! I
> will, like a sensible saving owner, husband my sole wealth, labour-power, and
> abstain from all foolish waste of it. I will each day spend, set in motion,
> put into action only as much of it as is compatible with its normal duration,
> and healthy development. By an unlimited extension of the working day, you
> may in one day use up a quantity of labour-power greater than I can restore
> in three. What you gain in labour I lose in substance. The use of my
> labour-power and the spoliation of it are quite different things. If the
> average time that (doing a reasonable amount of work) an average labourer can
> live, is 30 years, the value of my labour-power, which you pay me from day to
> day is 1/(365×30) or 1/10950 of its total value. But if you consume it in 10
> years, you pay me daily 1/10950 instead of 1/3650 of its total value, i.e.,
> only 1/3 of its daily value, and you rob me, therefore, every day of 2/3 of
> the value of my commodity. You pay me for one day’s labour-power, whilst you
> use that of 3 days. That is against our contract and the law of exchanges. I
> demand, therefore, a working day of normal length, and I demand it without
> any appeal to your heart, for in money matters sentiment is out of place. You
> may be a model citizen, perhaps a member of the Society for the Prevention of
> Cruelty to Animals, and in the odour of sanctity to boot; but the thing that
> you represent face to face with me has no heart in its breast. That which
> seems to throb there is my own heart-beating. I demand the normal working day
> because I, like every other seller, demand the value of my commodity.

Despite the important part which this method plays in actual practice, we are excluded from considering it in this place, by our assumption, that all commodities, including labour-power, are bought and sold at their full value. Granted this, it follows that the labour-time necessary for the production of labour-power, or for the reproduction of its value, cannot be lessened by a fall in the labourer’s wages below the value of his labour-power, but only by a fall in this value itself. Given the length of the working day, the prolongation of the surplus labour must of necessity originate in the curtailment of the necessary labour-time; the latter cannot arise from the former. In the example we have taken, it is necessary that the value of labour-power should actually fall by one-tenth, in order that the necessary labour-time may be diminished by one-tenth, i.e., from ten hours to nine, and in order that the surplus labour may consequently be prolonged from two hours to three. Such a fall in the value of labour-power implies, however, that the same necessaries of life which were formerly produced in ten hours, can now be produced in nine hours. But this is impossible without an increase in the productiveness of labour.

Whenever an individual capitalist cheapens shirts, for instance, by increasing the productiveness of labour he by no means necessarily aims at reducing the value of labour-power and shortening, pro tanto the necessary labour-time. But it is only in so far as he ultimately contributes to this result, that he assists in raising the general rate of surplus-value.

The real value of a commodity is, however, not its individual value, but its social value; that is to say, the real value is not measured by the labour-time that the article in each individual case costs the producer, but by the labour-time socially required for its production.

Since the collective labourer has functions, both simple and complex, both high and low, his members, the individual labour-powers, require different degrees of training, and must therefore have different values. Manufacture, therefore, develops a hierarchy of labour-powers, to which there corresponds a scale of wages.

Alongside of the hierarchic gradation there steps the simple separation of the labourers into skilled and unskilled. For the latter, the cost of apprenticeship vanishes; for the former, it diminishes, compared with that of artificers, in consequence of the functions being simplified. In both cases the value of labour-power falls.

Relative surplus-value is absolute, since it compels the absolute prolongation of the working day beyond the labour-time necessary to the existence of the labourer himself. Absolute surplus-value is relative, since it makes necessary such a development of the productiveness of labour, as will allow of the necessary labour-time being confined to a portion of the working day.

It follows from this, that an increase in the productiveness of labour causes a fall in the value of labour-power and a consequent rise in surplus-value, while, on the other hand, a decrease in such productiveness causes a rise in the value of labour-power, and a fall in surplus-value.

Only by suppressing the capitalist form of production could the length of the working day be reduced to the necessary labour time. But, even in that case, the latter would extend its limits. On the one hand, because the notion of “means of subsistence” would considerably expand, and the labourer would lay claim to an altogether different standard of life. On the other hand, because a part of what is now surplus labour, would then count as necessary labour; I mean the labour of forming a fund for reserve and accumulation.

It soon recognized that the change in the relations of demand and supply explained in regard to the price of labour, as of all other commodities, nothing except its changes i.e., the oscillations of the market-price above or below a certain mean. If demand and supply balance, the oscillation of prices ceases, all other conditions remaining the same.

==========

The capitalist who produces surplus-value – i.e., who extracts unpaid labour directly from the labourers, and fixes it in commodities, is, indeed, the first appropriator, but by no means the ultimate owner, of this surplus-value. He has to share it with capitalists, with landowners, &c., who fulfil other functions in the complex of social production. Surplus-value, therefore, splits up into various parts. Its fragments fall to various categories of persons, and take various forms, independent the one of the other, such as profit, interest, merchants’ profit, rent, &c.

For instance, suppose a cloth manufacturer converts £2,000 into capital. One portion he lays out in buying weavers, the other in woollen yarn, machinery, &c. But the people, from whom he buys the yarn and the machinery, pay for labour with a part of the purchase money, and so on until the whole £2,000 are spent in the payment of wages, i.e., until the entire product represented by the £2,000 has been consumed by productive labourers. It is evident that the whole gist of this argument lies in the words “and so on,” which send us from pillar to post.
