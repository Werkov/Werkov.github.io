## Chestful of gold

A pirate crew finds a box full of gold they are mostly crooks, they honor order
of command and democracy.
The highest rank pirate is supposed to put forward a proposal how do they split
the gold. If (strict) majority approves that, the proposal is exexcuted. If
it's rejected, the proposing pirate is executed and the second to highest rank
suggests the split, repeat until they make a deal.
Note that a dead pirate cannot own any of the gold (i.e. they prefer being
alive to owning coins).

Task: What proposal should the captain present (or any other pirate)?


## Deadly hats

A band of
[prisonÂ wardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_prison_experiment)
decide to execute prisoners in very convoluted way. They give out black and
white hats to the prisoners each prisoner one, yet unknown number of the types.
The prisoners stand in a row so that they can see hats ofthe prisoners standing
in front of them but they don't know their own hat color.
The wardens offer to spare those who would correctly tell the color of their
own hat.

Task: What strategy should prisoners adopt to maximize number of survivors?


## Cooperating prisoners (say number)

Another prison story. There are $n$ prisoners and each is given a number from
$1,...,n$ (not all numbers must be used, they can repeat). None of the
prisoners know their own number but they can check number of any their mates.
If at least one of the prisoners guess their own number, they are all released.

Task: Design a strategy for prisoners to maximize their chances of being
released.
