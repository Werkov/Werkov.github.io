## Plot

Plech is a film professional and looks for a drone operator.
He gets in touch with former schoolmate -- the droneman and they start doing business,
among clients is also a presidental candidate.
That opens new possibilities for droneman's private investigation of war crimes
by Bush administrative.
It turns out the candidate isn't so good, so the filming pair splits and the
droneman continues with his investigation only.
In the end, he attempts assasination of a related politician.
