population $p$, penetration $v$ (consider view count of a YouTube video), friends $f$.

Define:
$$
	P(seen video) = v/p
	P(your friend) = f/p
$$

You are interested if you can use a cultural reference among your friends,
consider this value
$$
	P(seen video|your friend)
$$

Assume independence (obviously wrong, however, we have nothing better in the zeroth approach):
$$
	P(seen video|your friend) = v/p
$$
