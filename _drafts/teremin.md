## Plot

Lev Sergejeviš Teremin comes to the USA with apparent intent to perform with
his newly invented electric musical instrument teremin.
We are also introduced to his manager Goldstein (a German) who strives to
improve his public image by telling a story how Teremin impressed Lenin by
playing the electric instrument (remember GOELRO) -- we realize he had
concerted previously in the Soviet Union.

What is revealed later is that he is also an agent (forced though) of Soviet
intelligence and they want him to "infiltrate" US industry by launching serial
production of teremins.

Teremin founds the electric orchestra to expand his popularization efforts. He
is accompanied by his manager Goldstein, musical polyglot Schillinger and
Samuel Goldstein. Interestingly, Goldstein was originally hired as a private
eye on Teremin by one of his fans -- later he is full-hearted member of the
orchestra though.

They organize a huge electric music concert at stadium for thousands of
visitors. Goldstein admits the most of the audience are members of unions or
supporters of the communist party.

Teremin has success and RCA company agrees to produce teremins at mass scale
and Teremin further exploits his inventor's skills with further little gadgets
(lie detector, altimeter).

Surprisingly, the RCA's plans coincide with the Black Tuesday and the following
Great Depression. Teremin's businesses are bankcrupt, he has debts and his fame
fades away. He is even not interesting for the Soviet intelligence anymore, so
they stop directing him and they even allow his Russian wife to come to visit
him in New York.

Seemingly, Teremin is not in love with her (and later he even unilaterally
divorced her) and Teremin is revealing his real motivation.
The teremin was not a musical instrument, it was intended as an wireless alarm
for the Lenin's office and playing tones was just a side effect and other
members of the orchestra are partly disappointed that they were part of a
scam/dishonest enthusiasm (that was most hurting to the musician Schillinger).
The situation is getting more and more depressive and Teremin confesses to (his
closest friend) Goldstein that the teremin is actually an eavesdropping device
that was to be installed in the Lenin's office by the intelligence service --
that also explains why Teremin was somehow extorted by the agents.

Despite seriousness of the motives, it seems that Teremin is doing all that
because he just enjoys "hacking" the electronic components and creating various
gadgets. He denies that he would do that because of wealth, fame, family or
women.

The story ends by Teremin leaving the United States and going back to Russia
and no one ever heard again of him.
