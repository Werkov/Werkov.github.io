high priority/non-maskable

absent receiver
- blocking
- retries

arranged dates (sync communication) -- time fragmentation

preference of sync to async
- being trapped and the door opening (call over SMS)
- con of async comm: harder to measure response times, timeouts

- multipath
  - as antipattern: send e-mail and call or come

busy receiver (even during business hours)

repeatability and self-documentation of written comm

con of async comm: harder to measure response times, timeouts
idea: new e-mail header Expires: (for optimized inbox processing)

con: relativity of time (logical clock)

- when real-time constraints are involved
