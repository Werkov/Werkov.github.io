title: PhD in computer science

This is a snapshot of my thoughts and reasoning why I chose not to go to PhD
and join the industry instead.
I made the decision a year ago, since then I learnt some new facts, however, so
the reasoning is most applicable for that period.

At the beginning, I observed the following two categories of PhD students (this
should apply to computer science):

  * They are either aces (both programmers and their particular field of
    interest),
  * or they are not prepared for the "real life" and want to prolong their
    student years.

Then I spoke to various people (PhD graduates, PhD students and non-PhD
graduates too), thought about it and made the decision.
Below follow some arguments and aspects of PhD studies.

### PhD opens you new opportunities

This is certainly true if you want to pursue your career in (computer) science.
However, I've met people who work on pretty cool stuff and they don't have a
PhD degree.

### I don't want to have higher education than my boss

I've heard this few times and it'd be true in most cases, however, I don't see
why it'd should be perceived negatively.

### Being a PhD student your budget is low

CS PhD students are employed and are paid from various grants so that their
living standard is IMO above an average PhD student.
On the other hand, salaries in the industry are also above the average and PhD
studies are thus economically suboptimal (on short term).

### Having PhD degree improves your qualification.

One could argue that with higher qualification your expected salary would be
higher.
That is true. However, don't forget that when you are not studying you are
gaining experience which is also valued by the job market.

I don't think it's a drawback, however, when you are too specialized you won't
do what you studied (if you are not very lucky).

### PhD studies thickens you social network

That's true, you get to know other people in your field of interest.
I'm too stubborn to accept effect of this, though.

## My decision

I decided to go to PhD studies, because:

  * I was sure, I didn't want to be a scientist/stay in academia,
  * I considered potential improvement in qualification equivalent to
    experience you learn in the industry,
  * I know people who are cool/successful even without a PhD degree.

Later, I found a thorough [summary of a CS PhD graduate][blog] that quite fits
what I discovered myself and elaborotes on some points in more detail.

## Assorted ideas

  * Are PhD studies preparation for life or *the life*?
  * PhD studies are full-time work -- I think this holds when you want to
    finish your studies on time and make a valued contribution.
  * American (western?) system of education is different and their PhD degrees
    are not directly comparable to ours (European?) -- we have this middle
    layer of master studies.
  * Don't go for PhD **only** because your parents want you to do so (or
    **only** because they have the degree too).
  * University is like monastery for atheists.
  * (Czech) funding system is (sometimes) wasteful (you can't have "buffers" to
    save surplus or to cover debts across (fiscal) years).
  * You can prolong the great years at the university (Interestingly, I haven't
    heard the praise of student years so often from people who earn relatively
    lot.)
  * PhD students are necessary workers of the science, they deserve respect.

## New facts

Some arguments that might change my mind:

  * Part-time studies -- this would apply if the studies weren't be the
    preparation for life but just a [hobby][1] when you are settled.
  * Study abroad -- the offer of foreign universities might match better my
    interests.
