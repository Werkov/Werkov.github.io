I had a pending invitation of friend of mine to visit Trieste where she
currently resides.
So when I realized (towards the end of the year) that I still have some
vacation days remaining at work, I decided to see what a sea looks like in
not-a-summer (the only way I knew it previously).

## 2016-11-16

- I arrived quite relaxed (people could understand English (up to one lady
  navigating me) and I had [valid money]({% post_url 2016-11-28-beijing %}#before-travel).)
  - The only glitch was 2 hours delayed plane of an unnamed Hungarian airline,
    therefore I travelled almost whole day including transport in Prague and
    trains from Treviso to Trieste.
- Trains were timely, impression was combination of old Czech and modern Czech
  (clean, ergonomic seats, aged windows and outer parts)
  - speed ~100 km/h (don't know exactly)
- I crossed crowded  *tourist path* from Treviso (airport) to Venice (popular
  destination).
- Train observations:
  - Agricultural region, water channels and polders.
    - Vineyards, palms, "cykas" TODO and regular grid forests.
  - All churches in the region (TODO Friuli di Venezia) have confusingly same
    towers (tall, thin, square cross-section and pyramid-shaped tips).

- Piazza di Unita -- huge and open to the sea
- While waiting for a ferry to Muggia, I noticed a weirdo couple who were
  meditating/praying on the pier ("mumbly rubmly, mumbly rumbly, ...").
- Muggia
  - Narrow crooked street, little church.
  - I started to climb and I quickly got to a residential quarter (detached
    houses, very calm, no pavement, nice views to Trieste Bay).
  - I passed by a church and a cementry (TODO) on the hill, enjoying the view
    of Trieste and its industrial area (metalurgy?).
- Lazzaretto (it)/Lazaret (sk) (TODO language ISO)
  - I descended back to the sea level and took a nap on a "beach" while waiting
    for bus.
- Koper (sk)/Capodistria (it)
  - The biggest town on Slovenian coast (i.e. ~50 km).
  - I walked through the historical center (Titov trg) and got to the port.
    - The center is neatly packed with picteresque historical (yet tourist)
      streets.
    - I was petrified by cargo ships that were like skyscrapers that could just
      move away.
    - Decades of standardization that allowed effective planning and scheduling
      realized by cranes (un)loading the container cargo ships.
    - I also saw a huge parking lot filled with hundreds of cars waiting to be
      loaded or dispatched to trains.
  - Later I met many schoolkids, realizing later that I was near a grammar school.
  - I finished my visit by a stop at Café Triglav.
- In the evening, I went with my hosts to a social gathering in their Italian
  colleagues' cozy flat tasting various regional delicatessen. (TODO spelling)

- I spent morning at scientific facility where my friends work (actually I
  met there another group of Czechs during their beam time).
  - It is for experiments, however, the infrastructure (synchrotron) is already
    finished and serves as a huge shared instrument (mainly source of .
  - 
  - it's just a huge shared tool
  - the instrument is complete
  - but free electron laser
  - dedicated (experimental) phycisist (using beam time till the last drop, 0:30 AM)
- Skočjanske jame
