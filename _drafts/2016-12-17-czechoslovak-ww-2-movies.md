Czech family (mid age couple, their adult son and father of the husband) comes

their "leader".
Meanwhile an unidentified dead man is found in local saw yard (TODO) and Czech
police starts investigation and Honza's son is the main suspect, which weakens
Honza's leader authority.
Everything is resolved when saw yard manager is identified an SS-Mann through
his tattoo and he is also found guilty of the murder (which is no surprise to

Finally, peace breaks out.

Interestingly, the only baddies are Germans, you needn't to be a communist to
be the good one (they are not important at all in the movie).

      band of smugglers (associated with saw yard TODO manager).

      be victimized.
