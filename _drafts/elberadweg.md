## Route planning

The [basic][1] variant suggested by [semi-official website][2] measures
according to mapy.cz almost 220 km.
The constraints for the trip were: a) sunrise (~5:30), b) bus departure from
Dresden at 18:30.
Though it was theoretically viable, I wanted to enjoy the ride, for instance
have a sufficient stop for a sufficient [lunch][3].  Thus I decided to take a
[shortcut through hilly region of *České Středohoří*][4], with it's measured
175 km it provided enough time reserve for various stops.

## The journey

I bought two bananas, some sweets, took ~2.75 liters of beverages and packed
some clothes for consequent stay in Berlin and set out for the trip.

### 8:59 Mělník (56 km)

Due to organization issues I departed at 6:00 from Troja.
There was already some light and the air was coldly refreshing.
Interestingly the light mist above the river was filled with plethora of
fishermen well about 10 km outreach of Prague.
I climbed the Vltava valley in Klecánky and saw the direct sun first time that
day.
When I passed through Kralupy nad Vltavou, I stopped at a gas station to
inflate my tyres -- I did not regret, the road surface was much better during
the rest of the path.
Even though, I had already been cycling for more than hour, people were
travelling to work and shops were still closed.
With accordance to my schedule, I came to Mělník moments before 9:00 and had a
short stop on the Labe bank with the view on the Mělník castle and vineyard.

### 11:07 Liběšice (93 km)

The scenery of the Labe river behind Mělník reminded me a maritime costs of
Mediterranean countries -- flat land, ports and cargo boats as well as personal
boats.
On the route, I passed by quite an impressive buildings and chimneys of the
Mělník (coal) powerplant -- I directly crossed the cooling water gutter.
In Štetí I crossed the river and began the ascent to České Středohoří.
The climbs weren't steep neither long (comparable to Vysočina) and fortunately
were shaded by trees, so it was a welcomed change from the flat riverbank path.

In Liběšice, I made a navigational mistake and began returning to the river's
course to Litoměřice.
I noticed this after I climbed around one kilometer after
Liběšice village.
I had great time reserve in my schedule, so I moved planned lunch in Děčín from
noon to one o'clock.

### 12:53 Děčín (127 km)

I cycled thourgh the landscape of the Sudetenland with small villages in the
hills, in few places even the logged houses.
I must admit, the hills affected my mood more than my muscles.
Due to lower average speed, I began to doubt my 13:00 arrival to Děčín.
Everything changed when I passed the pointer *Malé Březno 9 km*.
From that place it was almost continuous descent up until the Labe river.
I do not have real data but I estimate my average speed on that segment was
well above 30 km/h.

When I got back to the Labe, it was not the shallow valley anymore, it was a
canyon and in such places there are only two possible wind directions.
The wind (fortunately a breeze) was against me.
I knew I'd reach a restaurant in a few kilometers (and before 13:00) but during
this final kilometers I got my first crisis of the day.
Most probably, I was dehydrated since my blood pressure was low, breathing
shallow and I began to cramp.
I swallowed a (fizzy) multivitamin pill and drank, which helped and I
successfully reached [a restaurant in Děčín][3].

### 16:44 Pirna (176 km)

I estimated that in the worst case I could leave Děčín at 15:00 and still catch
the bus at 18:30 in Dresden.
So when I left the restaurant at 14:00, I felt I had a solid reserve to enjoy
the ongoing ride.
Before the lunch I drank ~2 liters plus another 0.8 liters for the lunch.
I think the afternoon temperatures approached 40 °C (in the direct sunlight
certainly more than that) and I deliberately increased by water consumption to
avoid another crisis.

From Děčín, I cycled on the left side of the Labe, crossed the borders in
Schöna and crossed the river in Bad Schandau.
I could see:

* how low the current water level was due to the drought -- there were few
  meters wide bands of stones on both sides of the river and floating piers
  were heavily inclined to the water,
* how hight the water levels were in 2002 and 2013 floods -- on the paths I was
  cycling quite a high above the river, I would still have my head underwater.

Being amazed by the river neighberhood and not understanding German labels
properly, I missed a ferry in Königsberg and continued on the right bank of the
river.
I realized it was not correct when the road began to climb and changed to a
forest path full of roots.
With help of OpenCycleMaps, I discovered a narrow path right along the right
side of the Elbe river.
The surface was poor yet the path was wide enough not be burnt by adjacent
nettles.
I relieved when I reached Kurort Rathen with road again.
Following kilemeters were quite exhausting as it was a really hot afternoon and
I despite being thirsty warm water from my bottles wasn't very refreshing
(though dehydration would be worse).
Earlier (from readings of various maps) I thought Pirna was a suburb of Dresden
-- well, it is not.
I stopped there to buy a cold (and sweet) drink and start worrying whether I'd
catch the bus in the more than 20 kilometers distant Dresden.

### 18:21 Dresden (202 km)

I assured myself that despite being tired I was able to keep average speed
above 20 km/h thus making it possible to catch the bus.
On the other hand, I was aware that every single wrong turn can prolong my
route and thus effectively slowing me down.
Fortunately, the pointer signs were quite good on the final stage and I didn't
get lost.
There were other obstacles though.
What got on I my nerves first was the cobblestones road when entering the
Dresden.
I would expected that the Landshauptstadt would have better surface on major
cycling path than coarse cobblestones where you could ride 15 km/h maximum.
Thanks to my prior knowledge of Dresden center, I expected the second problem
-- the overcrowded center and somehow cycled through it up to the main bus
station.

I was affraid that I was late (since cyclists had to be present 15 minutes in
advance), however, everything went fine then.
I took all parts of my bicycle that could fall off and the driver put it on the
rack on the bus' tail.

### Conclusion

In the bus, I had a little nausea (probably because of all that liquids that I
drank) and I realized it maybe wasn't the brightest idea to cycle 200 km a day
when the day is really hot one.

The final numbers for the trip were:

  * total length: 202.4 km,
  * cycling time: 9:26:56,
  * average speed: 21.42 km/h,
  * maximum speed: 64.65 km/h (descent to the Labe river from České Středohoří),
  * liquid consumption: 4--5 liters,
  * food consumption: 1 banana, 3 sweet sticks, 1 soup, 1 goulash, few handfuls
    of raisins.


## Berlin

In Berlin, I was hosted by my friend who provided me ground for proper
regeneration and the second day we cycled almost 100 km through Wannsee,
Potstam and Beelitz along the Havel river.
