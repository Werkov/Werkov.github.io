## Core principles

  * quick inbox for collecting various inputs
  * processing inbox into actions in the context queues
  * atomic actions, more complex stuff comprises projects (~project multiple actions)
  * contexts (work, home, errand, hobby)
  * dependecny relationship between actions

## Tracks goodies

  * simple dependency model (i.e. at least some)
  * scheduling: deadlines and tickler (show from)
  * recurring actions (with fine settings of period)

## Tracks drawbacks

  * need Ruby setup on own server or desktop compture
  * doesn't work offline
  * no support for multiple devices, poor synchronization
  * no propagation of deadlines via dependencies
  * no mass operations on actions
  * cumbersome conversion of action into project (i.e. only manually)

## Ideas

  * priorities vs dependencies
    * priorities vs personal preferences (motivation)
    * deadline-based priorities, other-people based priorities
    * relative approach to priorities (inc/dec, feedback based)
  * 60 % problem, when you put task in the tracker you stop enjoying it
    (whatever it is)
  * tracking pending jobs (waiting)
  * due dates are purposeless (either doesn't matter or ASAP, calendar is the
    thing you want)
  * trusted system
  * annual reviews and plans/goals
  * SG features
    * putting task to sleep
    * waiting for outer action, automatic reminder
  * GUI
    * should be easy to control by keyboard and typing (TUI)
    * similar to mutt's e-mail processing
