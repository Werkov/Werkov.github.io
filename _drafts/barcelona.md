## Selection

  * [summer trip]({% post_url 2024-07-22-cyklo %}) amazed me and I wanted to
    pass Brenner once again

  * time constraints only allowed me to travel in the autumn, further constraints:
    * travel south (warmer weather in autumn)
    * travel west (more and better cycling infrastructure)
    * easy train return connection
    * radius of 7 days
  * solution is the trip to Firenze, satisfies all of the above

## Preparations

  
  * stripped thread
  * no real path preparations
    * e.g. forgot to download offline maps for Lombardia

### Day 00 (2025-10-12)

  * **sleeping:** Tarvisio, hotel Tarvis


## Diary

### Day 00 (2025-10-12)

  * the trip starts by two-leg ride from Prague to Villach via Vienna, the
    morning is rainy and cold both in Prague and Vienna, the weather suddenly
    changes in the afternoon as the train enters the picturesque area of Semmering
  * the train ride wasn't boring (as I worried) and it was warm to finish
    recovering from previous cold
  * the first stage is only a short climb onto the Tarvisio pass but it's
    entirely in the dark after sunset
  * I'm on the tight schedule from the very beginning -- the hotel reception
    closes at 9 PM, Garmin ETA oscillates from 8:50 to 9:10, I even get a call
    from the receptions whether I'd come, in the end I manage to arrive at 8:48

  * **sleeping:** Tarvisio, hotel Tarvis

### Day 01 (2025-10-13)

  * the plan is to start the day early for the longest stage of the trip,
    hotel's dining room shared with other guests and also local workers
  * starting into a foggy day (it's the pass and the highest poing of whole path afterall)
  * I'm following the popular Alpe-Adria segment, I'm encouraged by fan
    grafitti, originally addressing
    [Rogla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo%C5%BE_Rogli%C4%8D), the road
    has very efficient descent ratio -- just enough to ride fast but safely and
    not to waste the precious altitude, signs of a former railway
  * I'm passed by German-speaking lightpackers trio and I join them, my
    sustained speed raises from some 30 km/h to whooshing 40 km/h, I'm enjoying
    the ride despite occasional undulations on the asphalt, when I hear one of
    my bottles fell off, I must return for it hoping to rejoin the group soon
  * what a surprise, it's whole cage that fell off (shallowly tightened screws
    didn't withhold the resonance], first day, first mechanical and first use
    of the zip tie
  * OK, I didn't account for such issues, let's continue, few kilometers later
    the bottle on the other side falls off, this time it's the holder arm that
    broke, sigh, I drink some balast and put the bottle on top of the bag, the
    mood is low
  * meanwhile the Ausrians(?) managed to have a coffee break, so I can join the
    group again; I expect to impress them with my planned 180 km stage, they
    triump me with their plan for the day -- 240 km (Udine, Triest,
    Postojna(?))
  * the 700 m of descent can only get me so far (~70 km), so I say bye and set
    out for my remaining 110 km, mostly flat
  * the wind gods were by me as I realized in the afternoon, I could either
    pedal and go some satisfying 24 km/h on the flat, or just relax and the
    bike would still go 18 km/h, I hate you gods
  * short stop at a supermarket to get a quick lunch (at 3 PM)
  * the last 20 km on the approach to Treviso were burdened with heavy traffic
    or zig-zag cycling path with roots
  * in the end, I finished the stage before the sunset and slightly burnt face
    and thanks to the accomodation, I made an improvised fix with one bottle
    cage on the top tube 

  * **sleeping:** Treviso, friend of mine

### Day 02 (2025-10-14)

  * I wake up tired and unsettled stomach, slow morning
  * few kilometers and half-broken bottle holder comes lose, another zip tie fixes it
  * this day's stage is on former Treviso-Ostigila railway, it means 10km
    segments with no turns, then a slight turn and I'm isolated from the
    surroundings by alleys of trees (actually good protection from the sun), I
    pass just in the middle between Vicenza and Padua
  * there are no natural stops, benches and it's overall boring, at least I
    have the odometer to count down the kilometers and time to next stop (I
    make stops based on time)
  * coffee break in Sossano, the only open place is a bar (run by a Vietnamese
    couple), then lunch from own supplies
  * the Treviso-Ostigila track started with gravel, I'm worried that parts
    adjacent to the Adige would be even worse (they're not even properly drawn
    in maps) but it's a neat surprise -- it's the newest segment with quality
    asphalt
  * (At one moment, I notice cyclists in the opposite direction are all wearing
    facemasks. After a few kilometers I pass a land of ammonia cloud.)
  * end of the day shopping in Cerea, I commited the sin of buying bottled
    water, I couldn't even contain it all in my bidons, so I at least gave the
    rest to a Romanian hobo (with whom I shared (had to share) the bike lot)
  * I intended to repeat the model from the previous year of alternating one
    night indoors and one in the outdoors, hence I found a calm area (from map)
    between villages and I rode until (and after) sunset. There were
    suprisingly lots of cars commuting from work (and people even walking).

  * **sleeping:** a playground near Correzzo (with all-night lamp next to head)

### Day 03 (2025-10-15)

  * happy morning as I managed to avoid dew (the bench seems to be ideal
    height, band with no dew), the villagers commute back to work
  * coffee break in Mantova, [well-known]({% post_url 2024-10-25-firenze %}) center
  * the tailwind is convenient (finally I'm not worried about making it before
    sunset) but it makes me nervous whether I'd be able to ride so fast if it
    ceased
  * the route is not a railway so it's much more interesting, I use compass
    instead of odometer to entertain myself (estimating wind's azimuth and
    calculating scalar product with my heading :-p)
  * Oglio bridge is closed for traffic (apparently for some time) but a cyclist
    (pedestrian) can pass, lunch break (own supplies)
  * Cremona -- first true city (sorry Treviso and Mantova): big church tower,
    sumptuous city hall, music museum, it's on a hill
  * I cross the Po river over very long bridge as it span the river plain too,
    is it so fertile that they grow fresh corn in October?
  * I measure daily consumption of 1.5 l water at some 21°C (+evening
    compensation in the accomodation), that's reassuring given the troubles
    with bidon holder
  * I spend the evening (at least hour) searching an accomodation in Savona,
    it'd be a sunny weekend so the offers within my price range disappear in
    real time (does everyone lookup their accomodation in the evening),
    eventually I have booked something in Vado Ligure...

  * **sleeping:** family B&B in Caorso

### Day 04 (2025-10-16)

  * I continue along the Po river, greeting black workers who pick cucumbers in the fields
  * Piacenza -- it should be similar to Cremona (sister city on the other side
    of Po) but I found it less impressive
    * a break in chocolatarie, ran by mother and son, only the son spoke little
      bit of English, I ordered three pieces of small biscuits and got them on
      three plates on a tray, it felt slightly awkward as I ate them after the
      clumsy ordering dialogue, the awkwardness was mutually confirmed as I
      heard the staff exlaim: "Mama mia!" after I left the shop :-)
  * in the afternoon I meet first hills after the days on the plain, it's the
    land of vineyards with some roads steep up and down (concave, felt like a
    fall), the asphalt has longitudal tears, I needed to pay attention to them;
    it's cultivated and apparently rich locality, there were some *vendesi*
    house though
  * (flat tyre on front wheel, comfortable fix in ~20 minutes)
  * evening shopping in Tortona, neat city that's historically the starting
    point to pass the Apenines here
  * the weather forecast was positive so I planned to camp at the bank of
    Torrente Scrivia but there was no place suitably accessible from (cycling)
    road, so I chose a field nearby, despite the proximity to water there were
    no mosquitoes

  * **sleeping:** border of a field near Villalvernia

### Day 05 (2025-10-17)

  * I cannot wait for the morning -- I'm woken by cold, I don't understand it,
    the sleeping bag should be comfortable down to 1°C and the forecast
    predicted ~9°C, it's explained when I check the thermometer on Garmin that
    spent the dight ~20 cm above the ground -- 4°C, however, when I stood the
    bike upright, the Garmin on the handlebar showed 8°C already
  * it's still quite a moist morning, the dew is everywhere and despite it's
    sunny, I cannot dry my equipment (mat, sleepng bag, tarp), the sun is too
    low and I've got kilometers to go and meters to climb
  * (As I was travelling west, the sunsets were later and later, I thought I'd
    beaten the shortening of days. This morning I realized my mistake, the
    sunsets were also later.)
  * the climb to Passo della Bocchetta was rather uneventful, when I descended
    to Genova, I broke the second arm of the bottle holder, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  * Genova
    * undisputable winner of the worst city award
    * highway and regular road above each other + cycling track in the middle
      but connectity sucks
    * I got lost and the path calculated by navigation was unusable due to
      local reconstructions, so I ended up cycling among trucks in the port
      area, consequently the road was congested by Friday traffic jam up to
      Crevari (~15 km)
    * OK, there were some historical streets and I enjoyed the exhibition of
      various Italian "armed" forces (Carabinieri, Guarda di Finanza, Esercito,
      Corpo nazionale soccorso alpino e speleologico, Protezion Civile, Polizia
      di Stato, Polizia Locale and maybe other) at Piazza de Ferrari
  * catching up with the plan in the afternoon, I reached Vado Ligure only
    after sunset, the main tourist "attraction there is ferry to Corsica
  * afterall a busy day: several occasions when I wanted to give up: cold
    morning, wet morning, no lunch in Genova, no cycling paths in Genova, heavy
    traffic in Genova -- eventually resolved by great accommodation with
    EuroSpin nearby
    * great accomodation means I could do my laundry and dry my camping stuff
      in the well-equipped flat

  * **sleeping:** rented appartment in Vado Ligure

### Day 06 (2025-10-18)

  * the nice weather so far was about to cease on Monday per the weather
    forecast, so I scheduled a longer stages for the weekend
  * the sunny Saturday at the Italian Riviera filled the road with loads of
    road cyclists and generally fit people
  * the map promised a level ride on the coast and tunnels of the former
    railway, initially slight disappointment as some tunnels were closed for
    reconstruction (October is likely considered off-season) and prompted for
    detours but when the tunnels were open, it was a joyride (light, dub music,
    passing through well-groomed towns)
  * Sanremo: lots of people enjoying their weekend time
  * (The problem with these long coastal segments is that there are hardly any
    places to pee.)
  * Ventimiglia: mapy.com planned a path into the middle of a tunnel and then
    via elevator uphill, I noticed that only en-route, of course the elevator
    was not for cyclists, so I had to climb the hill myself
  * entering France (no border checks for cyclists) and climbing to Monaco
  * Monaco
    * difficult navigation: lots of tunnels (lack of signal and 3D network),
      EU mobile data won't work (it hadn't occur to me I'd need to download it
      separately from Provence-Alps-Côte d'Azur in mapy.com)
    * a cyclist among skyscrapers, casinos and in the Prince Palace was surely
      an outstanding phenomenon, fortunately, the police were polite and
      tactful
  * a couple more climbs to reach Nice, I noticed that (rear) shifting got
    somehow imprecise, I couldn't understand how that can happen with Ultegra,
    if only I had thought more about it...
  * Nice (Nizza)
    * arrived after sunset
    * the first language I heard was Arabic but soon French prevailed (and also
      other languages in the downtown)
    * managed to do even little sightseeing (piggy-backed on the evening
      grocery shopping) 
    * first time staying overnight in a big city and first time walking (longer
      distances) after a week, I realized I developed a reflex for cycling ban
      signs, even when walking

  * **sleeping:** Nice, hostel, 4 bed bedroom


## People and culture

  * co-travelling road (female) cyclist in slippers(!) on the train
  * lightpackers -- road cyclists who have a saddle roll-bag but only with slippers
  * people who liked my bike
    * an Italian at Cerea supermarked, likes Canyon, has Grail
  * Italy: cemetery is always very visible from the main road through the
    village/municipality
  * San Martino building looked like having dents from bullets 
  * Italy: I'm the youngest cyclist in the countryside, whitest in the suburbs
    and smelliest in the city centers
  * two bikepackers in Nice: Helsinky-Porto (in 3 months), Stockholm-Valencia (~100 km a day)
    * my trip was dwarfed by their tracks, OTOH, I did more kilometers per day
      (therefore I didn't join them the next day even though we were going in
      the same direction)

### Food

  * boccio mantuana
  * I started eating more proteins on the third day as my nutrion would be
    mostly carbs (parmesan cheese turned out to be the ideal packing)

## Nature and

  * rivers
     * Tagliomento, Piave: unregulated, wide, creeks
     * Adige: I didn't even notice
     * Oglio: I noticed because of the closed bridge
     * Po: major river, go up to cross it (as usual)
  * huge flocks of birds in the vast fields of the Po plain
  * I did ~1° in day, that's time shift 4 min/day, daylenght in Nice
    (~centerpoint of the trip) changed from 11:10:42 on Oct 12 to 10:28:03 on
    Oct 27, i.e. 2m50s per day, so I outpaced the sun (at least the sunsets)

## Technologies

  * Austria: blocking poles in middle of escalator to force transporting bikes in the lift
  * Cremona circuit: very hard to see anything from behind the fence, it's noisy though

## Lessons learnt

  * don't type and drive (the driver in opposite direction)
  * mornings are hard, daytime always improves and evenings are opportunities for repairs
  * I still don't know how dew works, it's better to sleep to avoid it (higher
    place, under tree, not in the open)
  * Clothes washed in the evening won't always dry until morning. Order of
    effectivity: heating/heated rack, tumble dryer, hair dryer, towels, bed
    sheets.
  * Don't freak out when it's not dry in the morning -- as it's functional, you
    can dry it on the body (in given latitude/time of year).
  * Long trousers were deadweight for this time of year and locations.


### Driving

  * how to roundabout: if you take the 1st exit, keep right, otherwise push to
    the left and then cross back right to your exit (carefuly, looking back). I
    still haven't decyphered turn signals in none of the passed countries.
  * hot to efficiency in dense city traffic: when there's space in front of you, go (I
    picked this up by watch scooter riders (mainly) in Genova)


### Equipment

  * Garmin showed non-sensical HR (bad contact), increased average BPM
