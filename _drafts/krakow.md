## Day 01

## Notes

- many Germans, some Poles, not majority of Czechs in the train
  - and Frenchs with crying baby right behing me!
- display above the seat showed reservations on my neighbours but ~2 minutes before scheduled departure (we were 3 minutes delayed in reality)
  - but my place showed still as reserved
  - are there sensors? did they cancel it?
- learnt Polish pronunciation [krakúv]
- the train almost emptied until reaching borders (Bohumín is engine change)
- extra slow after Czechowitz
  - the difference was visible (slower, worse track lead, dismantled infrastructure)

- no vietnamese
- they use churches
- historical center
- old Russian ladies (I thought they were maids)
