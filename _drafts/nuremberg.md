	- this didn't hold when I helped a miss with motor scooter that skidded
	  on wet asphalt and we have to (with one more guy) put the machine on
	  the pavement
- the Hauptmarkt is not the main attraction, it's the streets around
- bells at 9 o'clock
	- on Saturday 7 PM
- German Google is different
	- image search shows the page
	- Fatboy Slim playlist (Fatboy slim best hits) contains copyrighted
	  videos, GEMA
- TODO: laufzeitspeicher
- historical center is quite different and bordered
- many houses with graphics on them

	- north side is not so steep
- smaller offices
- more bounded working hours
- short way to work

	- cycling
	- runners
