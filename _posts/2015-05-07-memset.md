title: Memset or memberwise zero
tags: programming
---

  * For sure it's premature optimization, thus performance arguments are
    omitted.
  * Thus it's a question of style.
    * memset
      * ensures whole struct is zeroed, however hides initialization of
	individual members (though they are usually meant to be initially zero)
    * memberwise
      * explicitly indicates what we are doing with the structure
      * prone to leaving out some members -> hard to hunt non-deterministic bugs
    * conclusion:
      * <del>**Prefer memset.**</del>
      * **[Use calloc.][1]**
