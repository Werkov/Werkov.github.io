title: "Working"

===== Knowledge base =====
  * You have to delve deep enough in order to new ideas show up on their own (in your head).
    * Alternatively -- you have to cache significant part of the domain so that you can manipulate it in your head.

===== Vicious circle of deadline =====
  * Deadline too far, no need to hurry yet.
    * Lay great plans.
  * Should start to work seriously. Do not hack, make it nice and take your time.
  * Deadline is coming, all hope to make it nice is gone. Give up.
  * Don't give up. Lower all expectations and do what's necessary -> no need to hurry.
  * Deadline is postponed, repeat from beginning.
  * (Deadline is approaching at deadly pace; stitch it together, lose overall beauty, deliver something.)
