  * new sunscreen somehow works (no pimples)
  * hot phone, it is slower
  * low gears, frequency and stand pedalling
  * heart+GPS measuring watch?
  * markings of MTB trails

### Unused stuff

  * most of sweets (desserts and ice creams instead)
  * pull-ons (lucky weather, not too high)
  * sweatshirt (-,,-)

  * deodorant (no accommodation)
  * 2nd jersey (washed and dried one on body during sunny day)
  * city shorts, city T-shirt (no bike-less breaks)
