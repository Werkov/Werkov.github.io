Despite I already visited Šumava, it was many years ago and it was never pure
hiking.
Thus I decided to utilize the Czech public holiday at the beginning of July to
walt a significant part of the Šumava mountain range.

It took as four days, we started off in Kašperské Hory where we arrived by bus,
we finished in Nová Pec and went back by a direct train to Prague.
The daily walked distances were: 21.3 km, 29.5 km, 28.3 km and 7.3 km.
86.4 km in total, highest point was the peak of Plechý (1378 meters above sea
level).
The weather was mostly warm (~26°C), just one day there were light showers in
the morning and later a thunderstorm at night.

## Practicals

- Šumava is easily accessible by bus or train. There are several stations under
  the hills and you can also get right in the middle where is Nové Údolí
  station it terminates the Czech railway.
- There are many hotels, pensions or huts where you can find accommodation,
  food and water.
- There is dense network of hiking and cycling paths in Šumava.
- Despite it is a national park, you can legally overnight in the wild at
  special places in comfortable distance from each other. There are box toilets
  (TODO), but no water source or dust bins. There is place for 10--20 tents and
  if it nice weather or public holiday some sites can be quite packed (as
  happened to us). 

## Natural sights

- Three countries border point: Czechia, Austria and Germany.
- Picturesque Plešné lake, it is a remnant of a former iceberg, you can walk the morena
  (TODO) and stone field.
- Mostly Picea abies (TODO), somewhere buk (TODO) I was surprised with Sorbus plants.
- There are many areas with dead trees because of kůrovec (TODO) and wind
  exposition. It is deliberately kept this way so that you can see how a
  "natural" forest looks like.
- There is a border between North and Black sea pomoří (TODO) which we crossed.
- Alpine outlook, in [theory](https://www.heywhatsthat.com/?view=QJ7I37S4) and
  we could actually see the dark countours of the Alps.
- Conduit (TODO) of the Vydra river, large round boulders. It seems it can host
  much larger flow, it is probably carved by spring snowmelts. (And actually
  some waters are drained to the Vchynicko-Tetínský channel (TODO).)

## Manmade sights

- Schwarezenberg channel (TODO)
  - A water channel built throughout 18th and 19th century to enable floating
    wood from regional forests, mainly as a fuel for Vienna.
  - Interestingly, it takes waters from Vltava rozvodí (TODO) to Danube.
  - Average decline is as low as 2 promile (TODO), so the channel appears to
    flow up the hill at places.
  - At the height of production it employed 800 staff to push the logs through.

## People

- The original inhabitants were settlers who came to Šumava to process wood.
  Many villages were founded in 18th century. The population was mostly German
  speaking (both Bayern and Austrian dialects) and was subject of Beneš decree
  (TODO) after WW II.
- Some villages were repopulated from Czechoslovakia inland after the war but
  that was just temporary as the military came to the region to guard the Iron
  curtain. To make the border less penetrable, remainings of the villages were
  destroyed/eradicated (TODO) not to provide shelter for illegal migrants.
