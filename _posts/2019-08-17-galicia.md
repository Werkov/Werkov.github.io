* cowherd -- talkative, even without knowing Czech
* girl in Mukachevo -- knew good English
* security guy -- knew a bit of Czech, liked Czechs, helpful
* Roman -- fixing bridges in Prague after floods, Czech-speaking grandfather,
  does not like Russians, small house with a goat under mountains now
* anonymous boy -- ~13 years old buys cigarettes and rides a motorbike (not
  that unusual in the village region)
* Bogdan -- yuppie from Chernovitsi, helped us in the train and Lviv,
  enlightened
* Poles ([2 guys, 1 girl]({%post_url 2018-12-05-tenerife %}#people)) --
  returning from a bikepacking trip from Warszava to Istanbul

## Misc

* unregulated rivers, wilder forests
  * OTOH, more litter in the nature
* polluted rivers
* polluted air -- especially the heavy trucks are green only on the coat
* bears smell
* open bar must have loud hardbass or 90s rap playing
* riding the roads is like an arcade game, avoiding the potholes
* Ukrainian universities participate in the Erasmus program
* double time-zone (official UTC+2, effective UTC+1)
* low efficiency
  * shopkeeper (cannot do multitasking)
  * train station (bureaucracy, technical breaks)

## Food

* kvass -- beverage
* borgas -- soup/goulash in Mukachevo
* lots of dill (regional)
* pelmeni, vareniky
* colored honey/marmelade?
* Polski bigos

## Lessons learnt

* fenders are not worth it (hinder manipulation, bike blocks splashes anyway)
* packing all above rear wheel is suboptimal (greater moments to carry the
  bike, overload of rear wheel/axis)
* too many bags/luggage complicate leaving a bike alone
* little backpack is useful
* (the points above apply to lazy cyclists who do lot of for city tourism and
  frequent public transport travels)
* maintain not only hydration but electrolyte concentrations as well
* no need to take both "membrane" and PVC raincoat (the former proved well)
* sandals almost unused (cyclic shoes stunk though)

*Grateful thanks to T for the photos.*
