title: What does 99.9% mean?

99.9% sounds like a very high proportion, easily interpretted as certainty in
everyday life.
But what does it mean when it really matters?

## Availability

When someone claims 99.9% availability of their service, it means approximately
40 minutes *un*availability per month.

## Survival rate

Survival rate 99.9% in a single period means the probability of survival is 1/2
after ~700 periods.

## Test specificity

Test specificity is the probability that the test result is negative when the
queried situation is absent or $P(N\|\neg I)$ (where $I$ stands for *infection*
here, $N$ is *negative* result).

Test sensitivity is the $P(P\|I)$, i.e. *positive* result given an infected
sample.

\\[
	\begin{align}
	P(I|P) &= \frac{P(P|I) P(I)}{P(P)}
	\cr &=
	\frac{P(P|I) P(I)}{P(P|I)P(I) + P(P|\neg I)P(\neg I)}
	\cr &=
	\frac{P(P|I) P(I)}{P(P|I)P(I) + P(P|\neg I)(1 - P(I))} 
	\cr &=
	\frac{P(P|I) P(I)}{P(P|I)P(I) + (1-P(N|\neg I))(1 - P(I))} 
	\cr &=
	\frac{\text{sens} \cdot P(I)}{\text{sens} \cdot P(I) + (1-\text{spec})(1 - P(I))} 
	\cr &=
	\frac{\text{sens}}{\text{sens} + (1-\text{spec})\left(\frac1{P(I)} - 1\right)} 
	\end{align}
\\]

Let's have prevalence $P(I) = 0.1\%$, moderately sensitive test ($\text{sens}=80\%$) and $\text{spec} = 99.9\%$.
We have no big expectation about $P(\neg I\|N)$ given the low sensitivity,
however, we expect $P(I\|P)$ to be high with such a high specificity.
If we plug the numbers into the formula we get $P(I\|P) \approx 50\%$.
It looks like a coin flip but such a "test" would provide no new information,
the coin gives $P(I\|P) = P(I)$.
