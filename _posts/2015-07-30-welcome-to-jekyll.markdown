I just started blog with [Jekyll][jekyll] using Github Pages. First impressions
(of Jekyll and Github pages):

  * nice scaffolding via `jekyll new`,
  * missing fulltext search,
  * non-intuitive tagging of posts (would use custom plugins or a workaround,
    I'll have to check it once more),
  * not possible to easily obtain last modification time of a post/page
    (thought it's present in the Git history).
