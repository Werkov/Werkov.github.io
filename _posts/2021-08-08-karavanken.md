- local minimum in Loiblpass (Ljubel), once it as a [local maximum]({% post_url 2014-08-20-venezia %}#day-04-2014-08-15)
- unexpected klettersteig prevents us from finishing the ridge hike and
  therefore we turn down to the valley

- shrewd Golica hut operator (he charged us for water)
- the expected group of Czech travel agency (we never met them)
- German? couple co-sleeping in Bärensattel
- (sky)runners
- group of [Brnenians](https://en.uncyclopedia.co/wiki/Brno)
- mountaneering Czech family
- friendly but misleading operators of Zelenica hut
- experienced Slovenian hikers couple, handless Slovenian former hiker

### COVID-19

- vaccination certificate ready, nowhere checked
- using facemasks in public transport

## Practicals & lessons learnt

- baggage ~18.5 kg (+salami, +tent share)
- lessons
  - check the planned route in advance for signs of unpassability
    - klettersteig marks (add them [when you know](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/110481722#map=20/46.43317/14.30576&layers=CN))
    - extremely dense countour lines
    - hiking poles not compatible with rope holding
  - transport
    - two cars for bigger environmental impact but easier return trip after passing the ridge 
  - excessive sweating
    - not a common problem on forums
    - I would need to analyze it myself (metabolism efficiency, muscle
      efficiency, movement efficiency,...)
  - sunburns after sweating
    - oint forehead
    - use waterproof/resistant sunscreen
  - risk assessment of extreme costs with low probability
