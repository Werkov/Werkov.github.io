## Plot

Abigail is expulsed from countryside and looks for a job at the court.
She meets her cousin Lady Marlborough who employs her as kitchen servant.
Abigail helps the Queen and after learning about her lesbian passion she
became her mistress (as her cousin already is).
Then starts the competition between the two women and the desperate,
emotionally unstable queen in the middle.
Furthermore, England is in a war with France and the queen has to decide
whether to give up and save money and lives or set out to expensive offensive
with uncertain gains.
The power groups in the government use Lady Marlborough and Abigail as
lobbyists for their respective causes.
Eventually, Abigail is more successful (and also exploits the Queen for her
private profit), she attempts to defeat Lady Marlborough who is expelled from
the country and the war ends.

## Comment

At first, it was difficult to get the grasp of the parties and relate to them.
When we learnt about the Queens intimate relationships it became clearer and we
could enjoy the competition between the two mistresses.
Abigail seemed to be the more just one initially but as her position changed
she was as selfish as Lady Marlborough.
She might have been better for the country because she lobbied against the war.
But as she said, her private interests just coincided with the interests of the
anti-war group.

### Addition after reading [the real story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne,_Queen_of_Great_Britain)

The characters are real historical persons and also the plot matches what happened in 18th century.
Just the intimate relationships between the queen and her favourites and the
negative personal traits are exaggerated to make the movie more scandalous and
popular.
