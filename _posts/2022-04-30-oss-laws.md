Not only *open source*.
Not only software.

[Postel's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle)
> Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.

[Gall's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law)
> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple
> system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and
> cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working
> simple system

[Lindy's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect)
> The future life expectancy of some non-perishable things, like a technology
> or an idea, is proportional to their current age. 

[Cunningham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#%22Cunningham's_Law%22)
> The best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a
> question; it's to post the wrong answer.

[Conway's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)
> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a
> design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication
> structure.
