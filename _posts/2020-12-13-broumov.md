## Diary

### Day 00 (2019-12-13)

  * **daily stats:** 204 km by train; 13.2 km, +260 m, -260 m, 3:15
  * **sleeping:** Broumov, [monastery](https://www.klasterbroumov.cz/)
  * sitting in the train with a respirator, not very relaxing travel
  * following the plan and visiting the nearby quarry and border (Poland) hills
  * overcast, so I only imagined the table mountains on the horizon
  * relatively warm thanks to steady air/tailwind (real temperature around 2°C)
  * evening return to the monastery, apparently, I was the only g(ho\|ue)st there
  * traditional headache after irregular sleep and lengthy travel


### Day 01 (2019-12-14)

  * **daily stats:** 24.1 km, +700 m, -700 m, 7:30
  * **sleeping:** Broumov, [monastery](https://www.klasterbroumov.cz/)
  * slower warmup in the morning, likely due to missing sugars in the breakfast
  * climb uphill and into mist/clouds, fortunately drops falling only from trees not the sky

  * rests of snow in the upper parts of the ridge
  * despite that the path among rocks was passable (but hiking poles helped)
  * the mist dissolved in the afternoon and allowed some views of the landscape

  * my overall pace was slower so I omitted *Božanovský špičák*
  * I met only one group (3) of tourists on the return path
    * hurried up in order to get out of the rocks before sunset
  * Broumov square sightseeing
    * studied an exhibition about recent demography changes 
    * negative population growth (migration), low education, local services
      hardly compete with big chainstores (located in Poland)
    * situation likely similar to other border promontories
  * visited café in the monastery


### Day 02 (2019-12-15)

  * **daily stats:** 13.3 km, +576 m, -536 m, ~5:30; 227 km by train
  * **sleeping:** home
  * short train ride to reach region of Adršpach-Teplice rocks
  * misty and windy day, quality warm up in a climb from Teplice to *Lokomotiva*
  * I was the only tourist in the region, the segment from Lokomotiva to *Kraví
    hora* was the most enjoyable (labyrinth of rocks and small trees)
  * slightly worse passable (glazed), the hiking poles paid off
  * later I got to the "commercial" part of the region, taller rocks and wider
    flatter pathways

  * even met low number of tourists in this region (usually crowded in the summer season)
  * Vlčí rokle, Adršpašské skalní město
  * scheduling the route so that I don't miss the train and I don't have to
    wait for it too long
  * the return train was surprisingly crowded (Tuesday, direction to Prague)


## Natural sights

  * Broumovské stěny (Broumov walls)
    * sandstone rocks on tabletop mountains
    * interestingly, the steep hillsides are only on the west, the other side
      are "boring" flat hills
  * Vlčí rokle
    * wooden planks to walk over peat bog
  * Adršpašské skalní město
    * it must be extra crowded in the summer (given the infrastructure) but
      relatively abandoned in the winter

## Manmade sights

  * Broumov monastery
    * magnificent building in the landscape, visible from far away (cf. prefab high-rises)
    * contrast between reconstructed and run-down sides of the building
    * thick walls and powerful heating system (felt even overheated)
    * deserted during weekend (and coronavirus), not so much during workdays
      (various evening lessons)
    * historically and (IMO) recently important institution in the area
    * I recommend the accommodation there
  * basalt quarry near Rožmitál
    * it's still active but it's possible to officially visit the unused area


## People

  * accommodation manager
    * unsure about handshake so we did elbow bump
  * kitchen maid
    * the serving I got was more than one person could consume (although I was
      the only guest), I had a dilemma whether to eat as much as I can or leave
      some food unused (and likely wasted)
  * more people in the town center wore masks than in the street of Prague
  * encounter with a desperate? girl in one of the monastery corridors (she was charging her phone)





## Lessons learnt

  * reading Kindle on such vacation doesn't work (reading Wikipedia instead)
  * arrange Christmas presents before vacation (!)
