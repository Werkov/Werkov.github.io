population $p$, penetration $v$ (consider view count of a YouTube video), friends $f$.

Define:
$$
	P(\t{seen video}) = v/p\\
	P(\t{your friend}) = f/p
$$

You are interested if you can use a cultural reference among your friends,
consider this value
$$
	P(\t{seen video}|\t{your friend})
$$

Assume independence (obviously wrong, however, we have nothing better in the zeroth approach):
$$
	P(\t{seen video}|\t{your friend}) = v/p
$$

Oh, [XKCD already got it quantified](https://xkcd.com/1053/) too.
