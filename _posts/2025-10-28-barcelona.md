## Selection and preparations

  * the target selection was not so involved like [previous year's trip]({%
    post_url 2024-10-25-firenze %}), Barcelona was one of the cities I wished
    to visit and it'd also make me [finally]({% post_url 2018-04-04-mallorca %})
    [visit]({% post_url 2018-12-05-tenerife %})
    [continental]({% post_url 2019-03-31-mallorca %}) Spain so I only waited
    for an opportunity when I can take long vacation and when I am physically
    able to perform >100 km/day trip

  * the shortest path from Prague to Barcelona goes north of the Alps which I
    refused because of a) worse weather at the time of year, b) missing the
    seaside, c) higher costs in Switzerland
  * the shortest path through Monaco (bypassing the Alps) leads over
    Brennerpass and Bolzano, I didn't want to ride the same route every year
    (and also the train connections to Salzburg were restricted in the autumn)
  * thus the chosen path was inspired by train connections reachability from
    Prague via Vienna -- the route planning was very rough (e.g. forgot to
    download offline maps for Lombardia), intentionally, I didn't know how far
    and how fast would I cycle
  * I only booked a bus ticket, conveniently direct connection from Barcelona
    to Prague
  * the trip was jeopardized by a stripped thread in the frame for rear wheel's
    thru-axle (official repair had due only in Apr 2026, fortunately, a bootleg
    axis with nut proved well)

## Diary

### Day 00 (2025-10-12) Train through Austria

  * the trip starts by two-leg ride from Prague to Villach via Vienna, the
    morning is rainy and cold both in Prague and Vienna, the weather suddenly
    changes in the afternoon as the train enters the picturesque area of Semmering
  * the train ride wasn't boring (as I worried) and it was warm to finish
    recovering from previous cold
  * the first stage is only a short climb onto the Tarvisio pass but it's
    entirely in the dark after sunset
  * I'm on the tight schedule from the very beginning -- the hotel reception
    closes at 9 PM, Garmin ETA oscillates from 8:50 to 9:10, I even get a call
    from the receptions whether I'd come, in the end I manage to arrive at 8:48

  * **sleeping:** Tarvisio, hotel Tarvis

### Day 01 (2025-10-13) Hit it from the start

  * the plan is to start the day early for the longest stage of the trip,
    hotel's dining room shared with other guests and also local workers
  * starting into a foggy day (it's the pass and the highest poing of whole path afterall)
  * I'm following the popular Alpe-Adria segment, I'm encouraged by fan
    grafitti, originally addressing
    [Rogla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primo%C5%BE_Rogli%C4%8D), the road
    has very efficient descent ratio -- just enough to ride fast but safely and
    not to waste the precious altitude, signs of a former railway
  * I'm passed by German-speaking lightpackers trio and I join them, my
    sustained speed raises from some 30 km/h to whooshing 40 km/h, I'm enjoying
    the ride despite occasional undulations on the asphalt, when I hear one of
    my bottles fell off, I must return for it hoping to rejoin the group soon
  * what a surprise, it's whole cage that fell off (shallowly tightened screws
    didn't withhold the resonance], first day, first mechanical and first use
    of the zip tie
  * OK, I didn't account for such issues, let's continue, few kilometers later
    the bottle on the other side falls off, this time it's the holder arm that
    broke, sigh, I drink some balast and put the bottle on top of the bag, the
    mood is low
  * meanwhile the Ausrians(?) managed to have a coffee break, so I can join the
    group again; I expect to impress them with my planned 180 km stage, they
    triump me with their plan for the day -- 240 km (Udine, Triest,
    Postojna(?))
  * the 700 m of descent can only get me so far (~70 km), so I say bye and set
    out for my remaining 110 km, mostly flat
  * the wind gods were by me as I realized in the afternoon, I could either
    pedal and go some satisfying 24 km/h on the flat, or just relax and the
    bike would still go 18 km/h, I hate you gods
  * short stop at a supermarket to get a quick lunch (at 3 PM)
  * the last 20 km on the approach to Treviso were burdened with heavy traffic
    or zig-zag cycling path with roots
  * in the end, I finished the stage before the sunset and slightly burnt face
    and thanks to the accomodation, I made an improvised fix with one bottle
    cage on the top tube 

  * **sleeping:** Treviso, friend of mine

### Day 02 (2025-10-14) Boring straights

  * I wake up tired and unsettled stomach, slow morning
  * few kilometers and half-broken bottle holder comes lose, another zip tie fixes it
  * this day's stage is on former Treviso-Ostigila railway, it means 10km
    segments with no turns, then a slight turn and I'm isolated from the
    surroundings by alleys of trees (actually good protection from the sun), I
    pass just in the middle between Vicenza and Padua
  * there are no natural stops, benches and it's overall boring, at least I
    have the odometer to count down the kilometers and time to next stop (I
    make stops based on time)
  * coffee break in Sossano, the only open place is a bar (run by a Vietnamese
    couple), then lunch from own supplies
  * the Treviso-Ostigila track started with gravel, I'm worried that parts
    adjacent to the Adige would be even worse (they're not even properly drawn
    in maps) but it's a neat surprise -- it's the newest segment with quality
    asphalt
  * (At one moment, I notice cyclists in the opposite direction are all wearing
    facemasks. After a few kilometers I pass a land of ammonia cloud.)
  * end of the day shopping in Cerea, I commited the sin of buying bottled
    water, I couldn't even contain it all in my bidons, so I at least gave the
    rest to a Romanian hobo (with whom I shared (had to share) the bike lot)
  * I intended to repeat the model from the previous year of alternating one
    night indoors and one in the outdoors, hence I found a calm area (from map)
    between villages and I rode until (and after) sunset. There were
    suprisingly lots of cars commuting from work (and people even walking).

  * **sleeping:** a playground near Correzzo (with all-night lamp next to head)

### Day 03 (2025-10-15) Over Po

  * happy morning as I managed to avoid dew (the bench seems to be ideal
    height, band with no dew), the villagers commute back to work
  * coffee break in Mantova, [well-known]({% post_url 2024-10-25-firenze %}) center
  * the tailwind is convenient (finally I'm not worried about making it before
    sunset) but it makes me nervous whether I'd be able to ride so fast if it
    ceased
  * the route is not a railway so it's much more interesting, I use compass
    instead of odometer to entertain myself (estimating wind's azimuth and
    calculating scalar product with my heading :-p)
  * Oglio bridge is closed for traffic (apparently for some time) but a cyclist
    (pedestrian) can pass, lunch break (own supplies)
  * Cremona -- first true city (sorry Treviso and Mantova): big church tower,
    sumptuous city hall, music museum, it's on a hill
  * I cross the Po river over very long bridge as it span the river plain too,
    is it so fertile that they grow fresh corn in October?
  * I measure daily consumption of 1.5 l water at some 21°C (+evening
    compensation in the accomodation), that's reassuring given the troubles
    with bidon holder
  * I spend the evening (at least hour) searching an accomodation in Savona,
    it'd be a sunny weekend so the offers within my price range disappear in
    real time (does everyone lookup their accomodation in the evening),
    eventually I have booked something in Vado Ligure...

  * **sleeping:** family B&B in Caorso

### Day 04 (2025-10-16) Apenines on the horizon

  * I continue along the Po river, greeting black workers who pick cucumbers in the fields
  * Piacenza -- it should be similar to Cremona (sister city on the other side
    of Po) but I found it less impressive
    * a break in chocolatarie, ran by mother and son, only the son spoke little
      bit of English, I ordered three pieces of small biscuits and got them on
      three plates on a tray, it felt slightly awkward as I ate them after the
      clumsy ordering dialogue, the awkwardness was mutually confirmed as I
      heard the staff exlaim: "Mama mia!" after I left the shop :-)
  * in the afternoon I meet first hills after the days on the plain, it's the
    land of vineyards with some roads steep up and down (concave, felt like a
    fall), the asphalt has longitudal tears, I needed to pay attention to them;
    it's cultivated and apparently rich locality, there were some *vendesi*
    house though
  * (flat tyre on front wheel, comfortable fix in ~20 minutes)
  * evening shopping in Tortona, neat city that's historically the starting
    point to pass the Apenines here
  * the weather forecast was positive so I planned to camp at the bank of
    Torrente Scrivia but there was no place suitably accessible from (cycling)
    road, so I chose a field nearby, despite the proximity to water there were
    no mosquitoes

  * **sleeping:** border of a field near Villalvernia

### Day 05 (2025-10-17) Adventure Genovese

[![](/resources/2025-barcelona/20251017_081407.jpg)](/resources/2025-barcelona/20251017_081407.jpg)


  * I cannot wait for the morning -- I'm woken by cold, I don't understand it,
    the sleeping bag should be comfortable down to 1°C and the forecast
    predicted ~9°C, it's explained when I check the thermometer on Garmin that
    spent the night ~20 cm above the ground -- 4°C, however, when I stood the
    bike upright, the Garmin on the handlebar showed 8°C already
  * it's still quite a moist morning, the dew is everywhere and despite it's
    sunny, I cannot dry my equipment (mat, sleepng bag, tarp), the sun is too
    low and I've got kilometers to go and meters to climb
  * (As I was travelling west, the sunsets were later and later, I thought I'd
    beaten the shortening of days. This morning I realized my mistake, the
    sunsets were also later.)
  * the climb to Passo della Bocchetta was rather uneventful, when I descended
    to Genova, I broke the second arm of the bottle holder, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  * Genova
    * undisputable winner of the worst city award
    * highway and regular road above each other + cycling track in the middle
      but connectity sucks
    * I got lost and the path calculated by navigation was unusable due to
      local reconstructions, so I ended up cycling among trucks in the port
      area, consequently the road was congested by Friday traffic jam up to
      Crevari (~15 km)
    * OK, there were some historical streets and I enjoyed the exhibition of
      various Italian "armed" forces (Carabinieri, Guarda di Finanza, Esercito,
      Corpo nazionale soccorso alpino e speleologico, Protezion Civile, Polizia
      di Stato, Polizia Locale and maybe other) at Piazza de Ferrari
  * catching up with the plan in the afternoon, I reached Vado Ligure only
    after sunset, the main tourist "attraction there is ferry to Corsica
  * afterall a busy day: several occasions when I wanted to give up: cold
    morning, wet morning, no lunch in Genova, no cycling paths in Genova, heavy
    traffic in Genova -- eventually resolved by great accommodation with
    EuroSpin nearby
    * great accomodation means I could do my laundry and dry my camping stuff
      in the well-equipped flat

  * **sleeping:** rented appartment in Vado Ligure

### Day 06 (2025-10-18) Ligurian riviera

  * the nice weather so far was about to cease on Monday per the weather
    forecast, so I scheduled a longer stages for the weekend
  * the sunny Saturday at the Italian Riviera filled the road with loads of
    road cyclists and generally fit people
  * the map promised a level ride on the coast and tunnels of the former
    railway, initially slight disappointment as some tunnels were closed for
    reconstruction (October is likely considered off-season) and prompted for
    detours but when the tunnels were open, it was a joyride (light, dub music,
    passing through well-groomed towns)
  * Sanremo: lots of people enjoying their weekend time
  * (The problem with these long coastal segments is that there are hardly any
    places to pee.)
  * Ventimiglia: mapy.com planned a path into the middle of a tunnel and then
    via elevator uphill, I noticed that only en-route, of course the elevator
    was not for cyclists, so I had to climb the hill myself
  * entering France (no border checks for cyclists) and climbing to Monaco
  * Monaco
    * difficult navigation: lots of tunnels (lack of signal and 3D network),
      EU mobile data won't work (it hadn't occur to me I'd need to download it
      separately from Provence-Alps-Côte d'Azur in mapy.com)
    * a cyclist among skyscrapers, casinos and in the Prince Palace was surely
      an outstanding phenomenon, fortunately, the police were polite and
      tactful
  * a couple more climbs to reach Nice, I noticed that (rear) shifting got
    somehow imprecise, I couldn't understand how that can happen with Ultegra,
    if only I had thought more about it...
  * Nice (Nizza)
    * arrived after sunset
    * the first language I heard was Arabic but soon French prevailed (and also
      other languages in the downtown)
    * managed to do even little sightseeing (piggy-backed on the evening
      grocery shopping) 
    * first time staying overnight in a big city and first time walking (longer
      distances) after a week, I realized I developed a reflex for cycling ban
      signs, even when walking

  * **sleeping:** Nice, hostel, 4 bed bedroom

### Day 07 (2025-10-19) Failure day

  * the day starts early (8:30) because I have to stop at the beach for
    breakfast (which wasn't possible in the hostel)
  * I continue along the coast, it's Sunday morning and I meet thousands of
    runners and hundreds of cyclists (it was a regular weekend, [no
    race](https://www.marathon06.com/2026/)
  * I passed the riviera in Cannes with porters greeting me with: "Bonjour
    monsier!" (not actually me but it felt like that)
  * Cannes is where I turn into the inland and start climbing, the area is
    popular among cyclists
  * the day was very nice (Nice) so far but it suddenly collapses when I
    routinely attempt to change rear gear -- snap, the rear cable is gone!
  * I still have several kilometers to the main pass of the day (plus some
    hundred kilometers to the planned end) and at first, the pedals seem stuck,
    I'm worried about finishing the day as planned so I push the bike forward
    instead of coasting back to Cannes; I don't usually ask for help from
    passer-by but when a French (woman) cyclist offered advice, I happily
    accepted it -- first, guided me to adjust the L screw (this way I unblocked
    the chain and reached gear n-2), second, she assured me about closed shops
    on Sundays ("Decathlong are very French"). I confirmed the latter
    personally in Frejus and the former gave me two working gears to which she
    encouraged the rest of my climb by: "It'll be tough ride".
  * OK, so I had 36x15 and 52x15 (which I'd use for 24.8 and 35.8 km/h
    normally), one for climbs the latter for everything else... The cable
    problem brought me some luck too, first, the modified route was actually
    shorter and less ascending than my original plan, second, the delay saved
    from going through rain that I could easily witness from wet roads and
    humid air in Savernes)
  * eventually, I reached Barjols which would be enjoyable place in the middle
    of French/Provensal countryside but at this time I felt trapped: compromised
    bike, injured leg (heavy gears made my right tendon of Achilles hurt) and
    imminent weather deterioration, hardly anyone could speak English in this
    corner of the world and most of the services were closed on Sunday evening
    (vivat to local petrol station and Asian restaurant)
  * it was warm and dry in the old-ish hotel and I prepared an ambitious plan
    for a sortie to Aix-en-Provance and Decathlon there all that in heavy rains
    the next day
  * sometimes it feels like too many experiences in one day

  * **sleeping:** Barjols, countryside hotel run by senior couple

### Day 08 (2025-10-20) Rainy day

  * the hopes of avoiding the rainy day and worries about the mechanical woke
    me up already at 6:30
  * the shorter stage (because of weather) conveniently composed with the need
    to find a repair shop and have my bike fixed (internal cable routing FTL)
  * I managed to climb the "pass of the day" (400 m near Pourcieux) only with
    water on the road, however, as it goes with passes the weather changed and
    the forecast earned its wings
  * the final part is mostly downhill/flat so the hard gears aren't such a big
    issue as I dash towards Aix-en-Provence I can observe La Croix de Provence
    when the low clouds allow that
  * I reach the hotel around noon where I only unload my bags (oh, where are my
    mudguards?) and I continue to Decathlon in the same suburb
  * it's difficult to explain my problem (change internally routed cable) and
    constraints (I need the bike the same day) because I can't speak French and
    no one speaks Czech, English nor German -- Google Translate be praised, the
    pipeline is: mechanic, speech-to-text, French-German translation on her
    phone, German text (my "Sprechen Sie Deutsch" made a lasting impression),
    me reading, typed English, English-French translation and showing on my
    phone; finally the bike is accepted and ETA is 2 hours, I'm invited to leave
  * the bags remained in the hotel, the bike with the rest in the shop, so I
    end up with soaking wet cycling clothes, a plastic bag with money, a
    cellphone and nowhere to go. I'm kidding I can go to the nearest restaurant
  * the restaurant is in Italian style (I didn't have an opportuntiy to visit a
    restaurant in Italy but now I do it in France) and after lunch I order
    desserts, coffee and I sit inside alost until (afternoon) closing hour to
    fill up the repair's two hours
  * when I return for the bike (3 PM), it's still disassembled on the stand and
    I get a new promise -- end of the day (7 PM); it's still raining outside so
    I find a place in shopping mall's café ~kilometer far away; despite I'm
    bored and with a phone, I'm reluctant to book the next day's stage until I
    know the state of the bike
  * I get a call at 5 PM the the bike is ready, I'm immeasurably grateful and
    35€ in total is very fair, so I go finally to the hotel
  * fortunately, they let me to park the bike in the room and they have
    electric heater so I can dry out all my equipment
  * I'm more than a week en route and noone is actively interested in the
    stages that I share

  * **sleeping:** Aix-en-Provence, suburban hotel supporting handicapped employees

### Day 09 (2025-10-21) Provence/Rhône delta

  * chilly morning, tendon was good 1 km, first climb and it started to ache
    then it got better midday as it warmed up, then it was worse in the evening
    due to tiredness 
  * occassional very light rain, observing the life in Salon-en-Provence
  * Avignon had been a stretch-goal of the trip but the detuour through
    Aix-en-Provence forced me to select a backup target, it also starts with A,
    it's on Rhone and it's historical -- Arles
  * Arles: 20th biggest arena in the (Roman) empire, restoration started in
    1821 and still continues, UNESCO, also Chinese tourists
  * in the evening I was returning back to the sea, i.e. perpedicular to the
    coast with some headwind
  * last minute sunset on the coast, AccuWeather time was precise
  * the room in condo is like a cottage, shop too far, kitchen too small
    without dishwasher, it doesn't save much time (cf camping)
  
  * **sleeping:** studio appartment in Le Grau-du Roi

### Day 10 (2025-10-22) Day of punctures

  * first day when I use the second jersey because primary one didn't dry out
    overnight in the sea climate (it also rained)
  * I enjoyed morning coastal ride through promenade of Jacques Chirac towards
    Montpellier (much better _paneláks_ than the estate I slept in)
  * Montpellier has nice modern (sometimes brutal) architecture in suburbs and
    decent historical center
  * the suburbs are difficult to navigate, on top of that lots of construction
    works so I feel like half a day is over and I only managed to cover only
    30km of the stage
  * the afternoon is cloudy and windy with showers, fortunately warm
  * I fulfilled my "dream" or fixing a flat tyre in rain -- the result is I
    didn't do it properly and I had to correct it one more time (this time with
    a patch) and rear wheel is still leaking air every ~20 km
  * together with cross/head winds and some hills it made quite a tiring
    afternoon, I had little time and no mood to stop in Béziers for sightseeing
    (I only noticed the magnificent cathedral in the "rearview" when leaving)
    and I only slowed down when passing through the center of Narbonne in the
    evening, fortunately, the injured tendon didn't bother me much in climbs

  * **sleeping:** box hotel (former F1?) near Narbonne

### Day 11 (2025-10-23) Windy day

  * the weather forecast had shown warnings of strong winds for the day, I
    decided to continue without modifications of the route because: a) no time,
    b) direction was almost perpendicular to my route (with small tail
    component)
  * the wind among etangs is quite strong, smells with gas, cannot make photos
    one handed, I hope everything is fixed on the bike
  * rainbows, little (salty) droplets in the air
  * the wind was worst in Leucate-Plage, easy 40 km/h ride with tailwind but
    when I wanted to make a U-turn, the bike was undercut (I stopped already),
    bicycle felt like flying away (I only held the saddle of the horizontal
    bike) and my sunglasses were actually blown off (fortunately caught in
    roadside bushes)
  * as I was passing a footway bridge (there were other four cyclists too), I
    managed to ride the whole length of it, however, there were some
    pedestrians at the end and I had to slow down, then I was simply blown down
    to the side, falling of a small hill (~1m), Garmin incident detection
    triggered, handlebar (left brake) bent
  * a group of French tourists(?) helped me to stand up (I felt much safer on
    the ground, not exposed to the winds), we only screamed at each other,
    woman: "No bike day today!" me: "Merci but I must bike!"
  * observation: palm seeds are poppy when you ride over them
  * bicycle geometry is made for headwinds (cross winds can easily tumble you,
    tailwinds pull the clothing off) so it was actually a relief when when I
    turned into the interior and could cycle against the wind, also the wind
    was weaker between (sugar?) cane trunks
  * Perpignan, I'm starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel (as I
    made this notice during a break, the bike fell down in the wind despite it
    was ~70° leaning)
  * it already feels little Spanish (Rousillion region is former north
    Catalonia)
  * excellent evening light (clean air after wind) during the climb to Le
    Perthus/el Portús in the Pyrenees, it was of the easiest passes

  * **sleeping:** highway hotel in La Jonquera

*Photo* The winds in the area were really strong. (Even few days later when I
was returning by bus further from the coast, it was rocked by the winds.)

### Day 12 (2025-10-24) Relaxed day

  * despite I woke up autonomously at 7:18, it was a slow morning and felt like
    the last guest in the hotel
  * descent from Pyrenees along roads (and parking lots) of truck drivers, felt
    close to them (cf Angles Morts)
  * agriculture formed the first impression: I expected oranges and got manure and slurry instead
  * Figueres, birthplace and museum of Salvador Dalí
  * I get a pull from a pair of cyclists on long stretches towards Girona
  * Girona
    * rehearsal for entering a big and tourist city
    * soaring cathedral and center with historical narrow streets
    * despite sufficient time I didn't dare to eat a lunch in a restaurant,
      instead spent equal sum on multiple takeaways (empanadas were good) and I
      was still carrying sausages and cheese, loss of rationality 
    * but thanks to time availability I opted for slightly longer route in the
      afternoon instead of closely copying A-2
  * Riudarenes, it's apparently abandoned area with no signal (and closed
    càmping) and weird [forest colonies](http://www.canfornaca.es/)
  * the day turns into really nice and relaxed afternoon, even enjoying an ice
    cream in Hostalric (Catalonian fortress town)
  * furthermore, I've got even time for evening sightseeing in Sant Celoni
    (almost regret that I bought food in a local grocery store instead of
    eating out)

  * **sleeping:** lonely hotel in Sant Celoni

### Day 13 (2025-10-25) Final stage

  * the last stage is meant to be shorter with the long-awaited reward at the
    end, therefore I don't hurry up into rain in the morning
  * it's again a neat Saturday made for cycling so I route over Collsacreau and
    meet lots of cyclists
  * I end up crammed between rock-road-rail-cycling path-coast, I rode
    surprisingly many kilometers in urban area until I finally reached
    Barcelona proper
  * Barcelona is a cyclist-welcoming city, the infra is well-thought and
    omnipresent, although I was one of few competent cyclists (tourist rentals)
    and single one without an engine (delivery guys)
    * I "burn" bit of time by cycling to Barcelona Supercomputing Center (which
      is closed on weekends)
  * had myself photographed in front (back?) of Sagrada Família and officially
    concluded the bicycle travel
  * finally a free evening when I can just chill and Wikipedia 

  * **sleeping:** hotel in Barcelona (near Parc Güell)

### Day 14 (2025-10-26) Barcelona

  * sightseeing day where I tried to pack most sites on a travelling salesman
    route (through places most recommended by friends)
  * morning was rainy and my rain resilience was weak (shorts and cycling
    coat), so I had to wait in a café
  * hotel, la Sagrada Família, Cas Milà, Casa Batlló, Arc de Triomf, Palau de
    la Música Catalana, Pla de la Seu, la Barceloneta, Palau Güell, Torres
    Venecianes, Castell de Montjuïc, (metro), hotel
  * the last supper in El Glop with many courses (what a contrast to sleeping
    on a bench near Correzzo)
  * the experience is so much stronger when I had to endure the two weeks trip,
    cannot compare it with just an "Euro weekend", my notes said that I felt
    Barcelona-sick before departure

  * **sleeping:** hotel in Barcelona (near Parc Güell)

### Day 15 (2025-10-27) Return day

  * early mornign to catch bus (I had to do without my (pre-paid) breakfast)
  * 26h rollback by bus
    * less comfortable than train but so much cheaper (and direct/quicker)
    * less hassle with bike than airplane
    * I can admire some of the missed sites during day time: landscape from A9
      near Avignon, Mont Ventoux, Fortresse Mornas

  * **sleeping:** bus over Europe

*Photo* Demography in Treviso

  * co-travelling road (female) cyclist in slippers(!) on the train
  * lightpackers -- road cyclists who have a saddle roll-bag but only with slippers
  * people who liked my bike
    * an Italian at Cerea supermarked, likes Canyon, has Grail
  * Italy: cemetery is always very visible from the main road through the
    village/municipality
  * San Martino building looked like having dents from bullets 
  * Italy: I'm the youngest cyclist in the countryside, whitest in the suburbs
    and smelliest in the city centers
  * two bikepackers in Nice: Helsinky-Porto (in 3 months), Stockholm-Valencia (~100 km a day)
    * my trip was dwarfed by their tracks, OTOH, I did more kilometers per day
      (therefore I didn't join them the next day even though we were going in
      the same direction)
  * bicycle mechanic in atelier (Aix-en-Provence): I was not sure if she could
    understand my explanation of the internal routing challenge but she
    confidently accepted the bike (eventual repair was more complicated) and
    pulled the fix off
  * service workers in France: they usually don't get bothered with a queue,
    they keep processing orders at leisure pace
  * *hôtel de ville* is not a city hotel but city hall
  * French woman in Perpignan -- stopped by as I was having a lunch break on a
    bench, curious from where and to where I ride
  * father and son cyclists from Medinyá -- they did a morning ride and were
    quite fast, had a short chat with them, they recommended (didn't
    discouraged) pista nationale and were partially interested in my route
  * a young man who boarded the bus the very last (I'm not even sure he got a
    ticket) and later was detained at border control between Spain and France
  * Zollbeamter on Swiss/German border -- almost felt like home when I could
    hear and speak a known language

### Food

  * boccio mantuana
  * I started eating more proteins on the third day as my nutrion would be
    mostly carbs (parmesan cheese turned out to be the ideal packing)
  * superb sandwich in boulangerie in Saint Martin de Crau (butter + hunger)
    and sweetish pastry (fixme name)
  * empanadas (not Mallorquinas), various levels from hand-made through
    franchises to industrial (in grocery stores))
  * home madeable: empanadas, patata omelette, pastís de queso, pesto Genovese,
    salmorejo, croissant
  * sweet bars: I didn't need them for energy but they were crucial for mental
    fatigue (tyre repairs, snapped cable, Barjols evening)

## Nature

  * rivers
     * Tagliomento, Piave: unregulated, wide, creeks
     * Adige: I didn't even notice
     * Oglio: I noticed because of the closed bridge
     * Po: major river, go up to cross it (as usual)

  * huge flocks of birds in the vast fields of the Po plain
  * highlands of Provence interior, tabletop mountains, La Croix de Provence
  * seagulls are like kites that fly autonomously
  * Rhoneland is similar agricultural scenery like around Po, drier, coarser,
    less sandy (I closely missed the bifurcation of Le Petit Rhône in Arles)
  * flamingos in coastal étangs

  * tempête Benjamin (windstorm that passed over France when I was among
    étangs), [Leucate station](https://meteostat.net/en/station/07666?t=2025-10-22/2025-10-24)
    has recorded winds of 70 km/h (not gusts)

  * I did ~1° in day, that's time shift 4 min/day, daylenght in Nice
    (~centerpoint of the trip) changed from 11:10:42 on Oct 12 to 10:28:03 on
    Oct 27, i.e. 2m50s per day, so I outpaced the sun (at least the sunsets)

## Technologies and man-made sites

  * Austria: blocking poles in middle of escalator to force transporting bikes in the lift
  * Cremona circuit: very hard to see anything from behind the fence, it's noisy though
  * TGV train on a bridge between Éguilles and Salon-en-Provence
  * The bigger road, the more energy efficient routing. Read: the least effort
    passes and paths to them are typically "occupied" by highways with no space
    for cyclable road. In contrast, the biggest roads route through tunnels or
        bridges and natural paths remain for cyclists.
  * [EV8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EV8_The_Mediterranean_Route) the
    international cycling path that I (unwittingly) copied in certain segments.
  * Array of trees planted in rectagular patterns (Italy, France (seen from bus))
  * Tollbooths (France) are huge vasts of asphalt, maybe it's worth it in those
    areas with long internode distances.
  * Barcelona: pedestrian red light is more like a recommendation than a stop,
    likely caused by not turning the lights off during low traffic times.

## Lessons learnt

  * mornings are hard, daytime always improves and evenings are opportunities for repairs
  * I still don't know how dew works, it's better to sleep to avoid it (higher
    place, under tree, not in the open)
  * Clothes washed in the evening won't always dry until morning. Order of
    effectivity: heating/heated rack, tumble dryer, hair dryer, towels, bed
    sheets.
  * Don't freak out when it's not dry in the morning -- as it's functional, you
    can dry it on the body (in given latitude/time of year).
  * Long trousers were deadweight for this time of year and locations.
  * Mediterranean (Provence) rain: radar cannot be trusted because rain spawns
    from nothing.
  * Effects of high gear pedaling: slight lower backpain, sligt arm muscles
    overload, big problems with tendon of Achilles (might be from previous
    bruises by pedal on right calf).
  * 400g of raw torsades is much more than 400g of raw rigatoni (after cooking).
  * Hotel is better than private hosting in this time of year due to heating
    and drying options.
  * Do not install new tube until you identify the cause (a thorn/shard/metal in the tyre).
  * Mental energy and will are also a resource that can get depleted (trial by punctures).
  * Riding along the coast with beaches (beach := coast in an urban area) is
    convenient and often picturesque but the problem is toilet (no natural
    spots to pee and lots of people everywhere).


### Driving

  * how to roundabout: if you take the 1st exit, keep right, otherwise push to
    the left and then cross back right to your exit (carefuly, looking back). I
    still haven't decyphered turn signals in none of the passed countries.
  * don't type and drive (the driver in opposite direction)
  * hot to efficiency in dense city traffic: when there's space in front of you, go (I
    picked this up by watch scooter riders (mainly) in Genova)
  * OpenStreetMaps and road cycling routing -- the convention in Spain was
    obviously different than in Italy and France, roads marked as suitable for
    road bikes (mapy.com) were often unpaved with roots or stones.
  * Expect/account for rush hours: Fridays outwards from big centers.
  * todo - 2D diagram: speed x distance when cars are passing, Italy is close but slow,  Spain is faster and much further


### Equipment

  * Garmin showed non-sensical HR (bad contact), increased average BPM
  * It may be good to remember to take also an _un_-packing photo to have a
    validated list.
