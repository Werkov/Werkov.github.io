## Selection

  * [summer trip]({% post_url 2024-07-22-cyklo %}) amazed me and I wanted to
    pass Brenner once again
  * time constraints only allowed me to travel in the autumn, further constraints:
    * travel south (warmer weather in autumn)
    * travel west (more and better cycling infrastructure)
    * easy train return connection
    * radius of 7 days
  * solution is the trip to Firenze, satisfies all of the above

## Preparations

  * postponed departure one day because of expected rain on day 02
  * planned 690 km, real 774 km in 39:40 (5260 m climb)

  * **daily stats:** 105.72 km, 5:45, 922 m
  * **sleeping:** Igls, hotel
  * night started headache (?? neck muscles), departing with it; throat itching due to smog?
  * breakfast, large serving of scrambled eggs
  * morning was cold and foggy, fortunately also hilly, tunnel scarf
  * later sunny, short-sleeved pauses but "wind" from riding mandated a jacket
  * late lunch in Jenbach, Inn part afterwards is a lot industrial
  * final climb: not a cycling path, traffic (one screen wipe sprayer)

### Day 02 (2024-10-20)

  * **daily stats:** 105.19 km, 5:58, 1270 m
  * **sleeping:** down from Brixen, shelter

  * very good morning weather, mountains illumination
  * road (re)constructions continued from the summer
  * descent is easy, sometimes cold, traces of night rain, lunch in Vipiteno
  * Brixen was sunny and warm, like an orchard
  * 1st shelter occupied by cycling couple, next one in few kilometers was a
    good shelter but humidity and danger of tidal wave (river)

### Day 03 (2024-10-21)

  * **daily stats:** 144.90 km, 6:36, 344 m
  * **sleeping:** Avio, hotel
  * no dew under the shelter next to the river (moisture in breath visible though)
  * Klausen--Bolzano -- steeper downhill, tunnels of former railway
  * Bolzano--Trento -- road cycling paradise, valley is wider, limestone cliffs on both sides, irrigation system all around, rarely a place for WC (unless you go off the path)
    * chasing with pensioners: them 25 km/h on e-bikes, me 25.2 km/h and passing
  * valley still continued with cliffs, hillsides and castles, I was lucky to experience it in this lighting
  * arrival later than expected after sunset (8:51 elapsed, 6:33 moving)

### Day 04 (2024-10-22)

  * **daily stats:** 142.49 km, 6:43, 558 m
  * **sleeping:** ~Concordia sulla Secchia, tarp

  * great breakfast in the hotel ( no scam happened, gave them tip)
  * start into the cold morning, then sweating in a climb before Garda
  * closed road because of falling stones
  * Lago di Garda, stop at Pesciera
  * Minzio river was a boring descend, overtaking e-bike tourists but few roadies did me
  * despite boredom, kilometers passed well so I continued up to Mantova
  * approach to Po was cloudy, passed it over a closed bridge
  * terrain with irrigation dams is not ideal for stealthy sleeping

### Day 05 (2024-10-23)

  * **daily stats:** 135.49 km, 7:04, 838 m
  * **sleeping:** Creda, pension
  * slept under tarp, night rain and foggy morning, packed wet stuff, little breakfast
  * foggy but warm morning, stop after 3/4 hour in a supermarket in Mantiola, bigger breakfast to hold tradition
  * continued to Bologna, boring flat terrain, light rain
  * hesitating whether to ride through Bologna city center, decided for the detour
  * downpour, being soaking wet, road constructions and traffic jams made the
    way to the center challenging -- doubted possibility of reaching the hotel
    at that moment 
  * finally reached Café Universitá (first search result from Garmin navigation
    to "university"), trembling with cold
  * walking tour through center turned out much better than queueing in traffic on circuit again
  * flash floods of mug, random mug splats
  * another heavy rain, this time I don't care because I'm wet already, stared ascent to Apenines
  * lots of water flowing against me down
  * cosy but cold/humid accommodation (clothes didn't dry up completely)
  * full dinner with both primi and secondi in nearby restaurant

### Day 06 (2024-10-24)

  * **daily stats:** 66.72 km, 3:23, 569 m
  * **sleeping:** NightJet 40294 train

  * start into warm and foggy morning, sightly later (because of misunderstanding of breakfast time)
  * curiously expected what the weather would be like on the other side, not
    even reached the pass and caught the first downpour of the day
  * road was closed due cars because of landslide, there was a strip for walkers/ cyclists

  * climb was easy, descent was hellish, heavy rain while going down, didn't
    see much, didn't take any photos
  * completely washed, shoes full of water from the top
  * downpour repeated multiple times, fortunately, it was warm ~18°C
  * fortunately, there was bit of sun on the last descent to city, I could dry
    contact layer, softshell jacket was full of water but warm
  * eye-catching sellers with laser beams
  * waiting for the belated train (all trains from Rome came late that evening)

### Day 07 (2024-10-25)

  * **daily stats:** 48.31 km, 2:12, 160 m
  * **sleeping:** home
  * night on train was cold (misconfigured AC)
  * must have recalibrated price levels and temperature in Vienna
  * utilized 5h train connection reserve -- Donauinsel flat track, one way wind (lucky)
  * Vienna pub full of pensioners + family with children

## People and culture

  * a road cyclist on train to Linz
  * Studentin on train to Salzburg (calling her friend about studies
    (understood 1/4, accent? vocabulary))
  * "Havlíček house" owner (German speaking)
    * former road cyclist, two times rode to Sicilly along Italian coast, kind
    * collaboration with Havlíčkův Brod, not a tourist attraction
  * bike-packing couple occupying shelter near Brixen
  * scammy-looking fishermen in the city Pesciera
  * Bianchi cyclists overtaking me every time in Garda area
  * waiter in Mantova, interested in my bicycle and equipment, good discussion
  * two bikepacking women in Bolognina, only said hi, unclear whether they
    stopped because of rain or to have a snack
  * 3 PM--7PM siesta
  * spoke German with anyone available
    * understanding was slightly harder, locals must have adapted their speech tempo
    * "Wohin geht es noch?" asked by a German in Brenner
  * Adige towns
    * Brixen = orchard
    * Bolzano = similar case like Brixen, crossing of multiple valleys but richer, a park
    * Trento is industrial and multicultural
      * you get charged extra for speaking German unlike the other two where
        you get a discount, [Salerno is the border](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprachgrenze#Italien)
  * Bologna
    * lots of students and young people in general
    * many interesting Renaissance buildings, many covered walkways
    * big square, _two_ leaning towers
  * Firenze
    * I didn't know what to expect, Ponte Vecchio was a good surprise
    * at first I was skeptical about the city (after only seeing it from the
      hills) but when I entered the historical center,  I was much impressed by
      the amount, monumentality and distribution of the buildings
    * narrow one way streets not only for vespas but also cargo and buses(!)
    * lots of tourists and people in general, different demography than in
      Bologna

## Nature and technologies

  * fön headwind from Brenner
  * confluence of Adige+Isarco = Adige but Isarco is bigger on map and in reality
  * microphones listening water in channel
  * metandoto everywhere
  * (Po valley) to cross a river you go up, the bigger the river, the higher
  * Po delta is [below sea level](https://en-za.topographic-map.com/map-6ffntf/Po-Valley/?center=44.92046%2C12.27719&zoom=9&popup=44.93129%2C12.38002)
  * I passed majority of Italian river basins: Adige, Po, Reno and Arno
  * NightJet carriages were modern design, very clean, must have been only few months old
  * Austrian/German cycling paths accessory is top notch, Italy is catching up piecewise (EuroVelo7)

## Lessons learnt

  * shopping
    * locked bike in small towns is safe for a quick shopping
    * big malls car-only are impossible or unsafe
  * cycling path detours
    * sometimes good marking (EuroVelo, backbones), sometimes not marked at all
      and own navigation
  * late lunch but no later than 3 PM (siesta)
  * Mediterranean rain (it's like our summer rain without thunderstorm) 
    * take lightweight shoe covers
    * take an extra bag, I had dry clothes in backpack but no bag capacity to
      put wet clothes into (or different system for wet clothes)
    * it's possible to ride in heavy rain when there's warm and drying option
      at the end of the day
    * Squirt is useless lubricant in rain, take a travel bottle with oil
  * avoid being smelly on the train by preparing a clean T-shirt to the _top_ of the bikepack
  * flat terrain doesn't mean more kilometers but less effort, time is consumed
    equally
  * accommodation (shower, bed, dry, breakfast) helps and is potentially quicker
  * Jurek shelter is not comfortable in rain (too short, too low) and not needed w/our rain
  * city sightseeing with a bike is limited in entrances but extended in reach
  * reliable smartphone is godsend (and airplane mode helps)
  * airplane mode may be useful in real life too, at the same time, the
    vacation wasn't cleaning when the mode wasn't waterproof
  * audax races
    * big cities cause delay, restaurants and shops are in small too
    * racing pace would be much more insane and with more car roads
    * still hesitating about "credit card bike packing", it could work in
      practice (one could always find accommodation for the next night)

## Misc

  * consumption vs hunger delay
  * river valleys are industrial (concentrated)
  * routing 
    * rough route from mapy.cz
    * selected potential night points
    * day to day stages routed by Garmin Connect app (from current location to predicted night point)
  * Garmin Edge
    * issues with Garmin climb percents (like smoothing, recording is correct)
    * routing from Garmin Connect -- trust (cycling paths) but verify (highway)
      * navigation in cities is priceless, saves time & distance
    * battery consumption per moving hour
      - 17%  4:08   4.1%/h
      - 24%  5:45   4.2%/h
      - 58% 12:34   4.6%/h
    * smartphone consumption per moving hour
      - 18%  4:08   4.4%/h
      - 19%  5:45
      - 66% 12:34
