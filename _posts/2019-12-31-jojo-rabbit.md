not read this before if you want to enjoy all the details of the movie!**

## Plot

Jojo attends a weekend Hitlerjugend training and he's injured by a grenade.
Consequently, he is forced to stay at home and he discovers that his mother is
hiding a Jewish girl in the house.
Being indoctrinated with Nazi ideology, he initially considers the girl a thing
but he slowly turns affectionate to her.
Eventually, she is discovered by Gestapo, so she pretends to be Jojo's dead
sister.
Meanwhile, Jojo's mother is executed (because she helped a resistance
movement).
Uncertainty of the pair's destiny is interrupted by the final fights of the
WW II when even children are sent to the first lines and no one cares about
Jews.
Jojo is captured by Russians and treated as a soldier but Captain K (also
captured) sacrifices himself to save Jojo.


## Characters

### Jojo (Johannes Betzler)

  * 10 years old boy, fascinated (and manipulated) by Nazi propaganda
  * his imaginary friend is Adolf Hitler
  * rejects violence

### Elsa/Inge
  
  * Inge is Jojo's deceased sister, Elsa is Jewish girl in similar age (17) and
    appearance
  * her parents are dead, she survives in the hideout
  * she's more mature than Jojo and uses that to convince/manipulate him

### Mother (Rosie Betzler)

  * single mother (her husband went to the Italian front but the ending implies
    he's dead)
  * we don't know what's her job, later, she turns out to collaborate with the
    resistance
  * slightly alcoholic
  * despite she treats Jojo as adult (talking about politics), she never learns
    that Jojo discovered Elsa (although she suspects that)

### Captain K

  * he lost an eye in the war, so he's manager of a Deutchesvolk institution in
    the rear
  * burn out Nazi, slightly alcoholic and exhibitionist (designs a fancy
    colourful uniform)

### Adolf Hitler

  * imaginary character
  * acts bit silly, more childish than Jojo (it's his imagination anyway)

### Yorki

  * Jojo's (only?) friend who completes the Hitlerjugend training and we can
    watch his "carreer"
  * he is the funny character in the plot (unkillable, also naïve Nazi as Jojo)

### Fraülein Rahm

  * also works in the HY institution
  * mother of eighteen children, devoted Nazi
  * simple-minded and cruel, superstitious


## Topics

  * manipulation of child mind by propaganda
  * (positive) view of the war by the naïve child
  * cloned Aryan children (perhaps inspired by [Lebensborn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensborn))
  * despair of Germans at the end of the war (paper uniforms)
  * dilemma whether to turn Elsa in or help her (the former means he'd be persecuted)
  * public executions of traitors of the Reich
  * Jojo's book on Jews as their exposé (basically retells the fake propaganda)
  * (American) English shorthands for German names (Johannes -- Jojo, cpt.
    Klenzendorf -- cpt. K, Jörgen -- Yorki)
  * Gestapo officers looking like Jehova witnesses
  * scene where the couple is watching town destruction through window during
    battle (cf. Fight Club)
  * heilhitler as a greeting/verb ("Heilhitler everyone!", also used in
    repetition as in an absurd drama)


## Comment

The plot is forward going, there are no major twists (we can guess that the
mother would help the resistance, similarity of Elsa and Inge is also obvious
early in the beginning).
The fake Hitler, war efforts and Nazi institutions look like a parody but it is
actually based on real stories.
The exteriors convinced me that German town(s) (fictional Falkenheim) look like
Czech but closing titles revealed the movie is half-Czech (it was shot in
Czechia and almost all technical jobs listed Czech names).
I appreciate that the American(?) actors spoke their English with German
accents (not the main figure, the actor is likely too young to mimic accents).

I noticed some inconsistencies -- the town is liberated both by Americans and
Russians at the same time, which sounds
[improbable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_contact).
The second mistake is Inge's age, where Elsa says she's 17 years old and her
birthday is May 7, 1929 but the scene happens in 1945.
