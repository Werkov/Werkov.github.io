    * cell phone signal along the route
    * diesel engines shook all the vessel (the worst was the resonance when

### Day 07 (2019-12-11)
  * **daily stats:** 3200 km by airliner, 350 km by bus
  * **sleeping:** night bus Berlin--Prague
  * despite unclear plans in the beginning, I wasn't able to visit all places I
    intended to (Pico Ruivo, plateau,...)



## Natural sights

  * bananas (finally saw orientation of banana fruits on the plant)
  * Madeira lizards
  * blooming aloes (long antenna that bends as an arch)
  * water cycle (rain, condensation, rivers)
  * sound of the ocean hitting rocks (even 500 m above the water, must have
    walked, not heart on a bus)
  * windows don't dew, no algae on walls (in the moist north)

## Manmade sights

  * Cabo Girão outlook (~500 m above the sea with glass floor)
  * Santana
    * village/town spread in the hills/valleys
  * concrete in Madeira often contains shell shards
  * cruise ships (and their high traffic) in Funchal port
  * cars parking very close to a wall (utilizing the narrow roads)

## Practicals

  * arrival to Berlin ZOB at 8:30, ready at Berlin Tegel gate at 9:45
  * Funchal (FNC) airport can be relatively often closed due to windy
    conditions (raw estimate 1/8 days, extrapolated estimate 5 days/year)
  * there is no siesta (no mañanas+tardes)
  * levada walks
    * account for tunnels (headlight), watch out both under feet and above head
    * account for tourists and narrow paths (your pace is limited)
  * night in the north are colder and there is almost 100% humidity -- my
    clothes were wet in the morning as they sucked the moisture over night
  * travelling by bus
    * very dense network of bus stops
    * locals can use it efficiently (it's not where bus always stops but places
      where it can stop)
    * but only few major stops known to tourists
    * relatively cheap: São Lourenço--Funchal ~4 EUR, the longest line on the
      island is ~7 EUR (Funchal--Porto Moníz), taxi from Santana--Faial was
      offered at 10 EUR (might be subject to bargain)
  * showers, beds, bus seats, bus stops are designed for shorter people
  * grocery chains: Continente, Pingo Doce

## People

  * Czech girl -- short (<1 week) vacation, guided tours, hinted me about poncha
    * she was the last person I spoke Czech to in one week, so it was an
      unusual experience when I spoke Czech again after returning to Czechia
  * French woman -- long ad-hoc vacation over all of Macaronesia (continued to
    Porto Sante), gave me useful information on local buses
  * Portuguesse woman -- rented car, circum-rode the island, could pick
    picturesque trails (only) because she could reach them by the car;
    discouraged me from Porto Moníz and Pico Ruivo 
    * vacation concepts: a) short (quality) trails + car moves, b) always walk
      with tent, c) public transport + trips
  * couple walking dogs -- woman was shouting angrily to call a dog back, when
    I passed them by the woman smiled at me (cf. Czech, where she would likely
    still be angry)
  * Spanish guy -- came from Galicia to enjoy warmer winter, used to maritime
    life so had different impressions than me


## Food

  * restaurants use paper tablecloth
  * [poncha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poncha)
  * tuna fish steak (it's huge)
  * scabbardfish (espada) battered with fried banana
  * cod steak, with sweet potato (and normal potato and rice)
  * salmon burger
  * tamarillo fruit


## Equipment

  * new phone served well
    * it wasn't an obstacle but aid
    * neatly surprised by built-in features of camera app (time-lapse, HDR)
  * raincoat covered tightly and was comfortable
  * the (old) jacket was only useful against wind and light and short rain


## Lessons learnt

  * be ready for headache after arrival
  * sunscreen must be in the backpack, not in the hostel
  * better ask locals where the bus departs from than miss it
  * it is hard to determine good time when to put raincoat on
  * reading Kindle on such (active) vacation doesn't work
  * don't move stones in natural parks (insects under the stone are sensitive to it)
  * pack less sleeping bags and more trousers (shorts)
  * [OSM](https://openstreetmaps.org/) contour lines can be very imprecise
    (cannot capture jagged terrains)
  * clouds driven up by wind don't dew, (stationary) clouds reached by walk dew
  * arrange Christmas presents before vacation



### Assorted

  * calculated personal carbon footprint is 850 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>
  * umbilical cable -- charging all accessories until the very last moment
    before departure
