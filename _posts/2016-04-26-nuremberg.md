As part of my job, I spent two weeks working in Nürnberg (Nuremberg in English,
I prefer local names when possible).
First, read [article on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg) to
get an idea how important Nuremberg was historically.
I had left Prague in winter and when I returned there was spring already -- this
year I experienced the start of spring in Nürnberg.
Below are some random, slightly categorized notes.


### People
  - old but not fat
  - cycling
  - runners
    - don't smile
    - don't greet

### Holy Roman style
  - historical core is not that big -- though it was the whole town originally
  - the center seems quite empty and without traffic
    - this didn't hold when I helped a miss with motor scooter that skidded
      on wet asphalt and we have to (with one more guy) put the machine on
      the pavement
  - historical center is quite different and bordered
  - many houses with graphics (reliefs) on them

### Sites
  - the Hauptmarkt is not the main attraction, it's the streets around
  - monumental castle (Kaiserburg) and fortifications
    - not sure what is real wall and what is just wrapped rock
    - north side is not so steep
  - non-aggressive tourist attractions (not like Prague plagued matriyoskas and
    glass)

### Work
  - short walk to work (I recalled my years in small town)
  - smaller offices (with less people)
  - more bounded working hours

### Misc
  - bells at 9 o'clock (evening)
    - on Saturday 7 PM
  
  - German Google is different
    - image search shows the page
    - Fatboy Slim playlist (Fatboy slim best hits) contains copyrighted
      videos, GEMA
  - Laufzeitspeicher
    - interesting type of memory that I learnt about at exhibition at Museum Industriekultur
