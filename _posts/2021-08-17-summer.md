## Diary

### Day 0

- train travel, quite OK
- running in the rain

### Day 1

- bicycle trip
  - warmup, short(er)
  - acknowledging glades
  - enjoying new cycling path along the river

### Day 2

- slow morning, changed plans due to outer conditions
- good lecture about Bayesian probability (popular science)

### Day 3

- cleaning and maintenance
- good trip to the national park
  - good weather but first signs of allergy
- accidental socialization with old friends in a pub -- very good (factor of surprise, unexpected)

### Day 4

- trip to highlands
  - very picturesque sceneries
  - colder windier weather
  - the chateaux was underwhelming (but not the rest of trip)
  - allergy getting stronger?
  - brownfield visit, it'd be good to gentrify but there are still factories
- windmill
  - plain exposition
  - not much technical details -- it is undocumented and unique so it could only be estimated
  - the staff knew only the learnt basics
  - reason: it was actually a social living/flats (not a mill), most of the 20th century

### Day 5

- trip to water dam
  - almost trapped in fallen forest and river vegetation
  - surprising unquality of cycling paths, not really for a road bike
  - swimming on a lonely beach
  - good lunch and child labor in brewery restaurant (also teambuilding of a company and groups in the vicinity)
  - extension to the dam body itself, learning taking photos in automatic panorama mode
  - nice cycling path along south "banks" of the dam, flat profile, good forest scenery
- evening pub with another friend, discussing cycling trips

### Day 6

- travel back to Prague
- one quick AG test and pub after arrival
