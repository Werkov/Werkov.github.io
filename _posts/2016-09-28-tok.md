- very strong headwind
- exhausted by 60th km (despite having lunch in a pub)
- main climb started around 80th km
  - I could ride, but I couldn't catch even with older cyclists
- Tok couldn't be seen from distance and at top was no outlook, peak was quite flat
- I expected deserted forests of military area, however, there were more people
  than I'd met cyclists on previous track between villages
- harder and slower than expected
- bunkers at Houpák hill with great view
- concrete ground in the middle of forests (with some connected ways)
  - wondering what was the purpose
- there were warning sings around all paths (Oblast nebyla pyrotechnicky asanována)
- there were marked tourist routes (yellow, blue) despite mapy.cz don't show them
