### The model


TODO picture

The capacitor is charged through the resistor with input voltage $U_0$ and it
switches when its gate voltage reaches at least $U\_s$. We must make all this
in the time period $T$.

### Charging capacitor

\\[
	u\_c = U_0 \left(1 - \exp \left(-\frac{t}{RC}\right)\right) \tag{1}
\\]

and since it's in series other voltages are
\\[
	u\_c + u\_r = U_0
\\]

The energy is conserved in a capacitor but it is dissipated on the charging
resistor, it is $E = \int_0^T P \d t = \int_0^T R i\_r^2 \d t$.
It will be more useful to calculate the dissipated energy in terms of the
capacitor voltage so let's use substitutions based on equation (1).
\\[
\begin{align}
	t &= -RC \log\left(1 - \frac{u\_c}{U_0}\right)\cr
	\frac{\d t}{\d u\_c} &= \frac{RC}{U_0 - u\_c}
\end{align}
\\]

Using Ohm's law we rewrite $R i\_r^2 = \frac{u\_r^2}{R}$ and we get the integral
\\[
\begin{align}
	E =& \int_{U\_B}^{U\_T} \frac{(U_0 - u\_c)^2}{R}\frac{RC}{U_0 - u\_c} \d u\_c =\cr
	=&\int_{U\_B}^{U\_T} (U_0 - u\_c) C \d u\_c = 
	  C \left[ U_0 u\_c - \frac{u\_c^2}{2}\right]_{U\_B}^{U\_T}\cr
	=& C\left(\left(U\_T - U\_B\right)\left(U_0 - \frac{U\_T+U\_B}{2}\right)\right). \tag{2}
\end{align}
\\]

If we plug in the extreme case of $U\_B = "0 V", U\_T=U_0$ we get
$E=\frac{1}{2} C U_0^2$. In other words the same energy that was stored in the
capacitor must have been dissipated on the charging resistor regardless of its
resistance.

How long does this all take? The equation (1) (in the form of the integral
substitution) comes for the help again.
\\[
\begin{align}
	T &= t(U\_T) - t(U\_B) \cr
	&= -RC \left(\log\left(1-\frac{U\_T}{U_0}\right)-\log\left(1-\frac{U\_B}{U_0}\right)\right)\cr
	&= RC \log\frac{U_0 - U\_B}{U_0 - U\_T} \tag{3}
\end{align}
\\]


### In terms of semiconductor

We work with a semiconductor component whose switching voltage is $U\_s$ and
noise margin is $\delta U$. Thus we get $U\_B = U\_s - \delta U, U\_T = U\_s +
\delta U$.

The energy lost (per (2)) in one cycle is $E = 2C\delta U \Delta U$ where $\Delta U = U_0 - U\_s$.

The time (3) we need for one cycle is
\\[
\begin{align}
	T &= RC \log\frac{\Delta U + \delta U}{\Delta U - \delta U} = 
	RC \log\left(1 + \frac{2\delta U}{\Delta U - \delta U}\right) \cr
	&\approx 
	RC \left(\frac{2\delta U}{\Delta U - \delta U}\right)
\end{align}
\\]
(we assumed $\delta U \ll \Delta U$ for the linear approximation).


### Putting it all together
\\[
\begin{align}
	f = 1/T &= RC \left(\frac{\Delta U - \delta U}{2\delta U}\right)\cr
	\Delta U &= \delta U + \frac{2\delta U}{RC} f
\end{align}
\\]

\\[
\begin{align}
	P &= Ef = 
	2C\delta U \Delta U f\cr
	&= 2C\delta U \left(
		\delta U + \frac{2\delta U}{RC} f
	\right) f\cr
	&= \frac{2\delta U^2}{R}\left(RC + 2f\right) f
\end{align}
\\]
where $C$ and $R$ are fixed properties of the silicon layout and $\delta U$ is
the voltage tolerance around switching point, which is to some extent
hard-wired in the silicon too.


### Completeness

  * this models only a single switching transistor
  * in reality it is in parallel (e.g. bus width) so the power is multiplied by width
  * in reality it is in series (composed logical circuit) so the time period is divided by depth
  * in reality there is a constant term (various leaks, proportional to memory capacity?)

### Corectness

  * discharging the capacitor (presumably a numeric factor only)
  * assumed $\delta U \ll \Delta U$ 
  * neglected inductance (and loss by radiation)
  * drain through gate (constant term wrt frequency)
  * the capacitor may work in greater range than $(U\_s - \delta U, U\_s +
    \delta U)$ (this is likely the hidden devil)
