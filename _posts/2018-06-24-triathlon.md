- category *Klasik* is too easy
- I felt a slight need for number 2, could be ignored and satisfied after the race
- it's more tactical to have a bicycle at the end of the T1 (getting dry while
  running, shorter fighting through the corridor)
- food
  - dinner: pasta, chicken meat, pesto
  - 9:00 breakfast, 2 rolls with butter and marmalade
  - 11:20 a banana
  - 12:15 start
- 20.9°C water and ~16°C air is bearable (on 400 m swimming), wetsuit would not
  worth due to changing time
- weather was good, comfortable, no excessive sweating, water was OK
- event review
  - why is the event moderator needed?
    - too little people were actually interested in the final ceremeony
  - medals were only for children
  - finisher T-shirt was part of the start package
