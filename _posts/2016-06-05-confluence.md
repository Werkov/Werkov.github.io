River confluences are well-defined points in terrain so I was highly motivated
to visit this place where two important Moravian rivers join.
Furthermore, it was also educational biological trip organized by my friend
biology teacher.

Topologically it was a *fully remote trip*, i.e. deployment by train in
Břeclav, tripping (in remote location) and rollback by train from Veselí nad
Moravou (changing train in Brno).

# History

## Geography
- [Moravská Sahara](https://mapy.cz/turisticka?x=17.2455544&y=48.9125393&z=14&l=0)
  - sand sediments between Hodonín and Strážnice
  - adventurous bicycle ride
- meadows in Bílé Karpaty
  - steep terrain, high "grass" (~70 cm) and isolated trees (apple trees?)
  - very high biodiversity
- direct flow of Morava river
  - it used to be crooked with many meanders, it was straightened in 70s
