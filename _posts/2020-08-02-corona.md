## Planning

We started planning the summer trip in May and the intermediate idea was a
train move to eastern Slovakia and bicycle journey back to the outskirts of
Czechia while wondering at Polish views of Tatra mountains. The opinions in the
crew shifted variously ([COVID-19](#covid-19) is certainly to blame), it was
certain that that year wouldn't be altitude, length or sightseeing record.
We adopted only very rough plan with no segmentation.

### Traditions

  * Being caught by downpour ✓
  * Night ride ✓
  * Eating at supermarket parking lot ✓

### COVID-19

This appears not to be an obscure unknown phenomenon, hence I'm not including a
link to Wikipedia, you probably already know what it means.

  * filling up a tracing form (name, phone number) when visiting a pub in Bavaria
  * extra crowded places popular with Czech tourists (Šumava)
  * less crowded places popular with foreign tourists (Český Krumlov)
