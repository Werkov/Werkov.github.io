## Brottle 
  * simple arithmetics
  * optimal strategy was intuitively clear
  * 2D case just jumped to different row instead of enforced *hit*
    announcement

## Typing monkeys 
  * I knew principle how to get the result, however, had problems deriving
    correct probability of words within sequence
  * thus I solved only the simple version where I enumerated all possible word
    sequences
  * I had unsubstantiated troubles counting how many overlapping words fit into
    sequence of length S...
    * fortunately figured it how eventually, on the other hand I thought this
      get me to advanced group, I was 1082th though, so I went to the last task

## Less money 
  * I was a bit stressed (despite the fact, uniform 50 minutes remained till
    the end)
  * I had no idea how to solve it with repeated coins
  * I brute-forced single coin problem and did it as
    [subset sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset_sum_problem)
  * and only after implementation of subset sum I realized I must always add
    the smallest coin of impossible prices
  * before submit I was below 1200, after it I got between 1100 and 1200

  * I wasn't qualified and still about 30 minutes remained
  * I knew I won't figure out the coins (FIXME would be nice to understand the
    efficient solution)
  * I attempted to derive probability of words within sequence, however, it
    seemed complicated (=conditioned) because of overlapping words
  * in the end, IÂ was 1132nd and after deadline because of many people had
    wrong answers to big tasks (I expected that this would be 50--100 people),
    I moved to 947th place :-)

## Lessons learned 
  * I did it all in Python (I didn't manage to prepare C++ templates).
  * Brush up on discrete mathematics (counting the words, probability).
  * Learn how the coins should have been solved.
