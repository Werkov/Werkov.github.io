- room with artifacts
- not much parallelization, straighforward what to do
- not so clear how to do it -- fun
- later it degenerates just to identifying locks and finding proper codes
  - you are not paranoid, just look for whatever looks like a code or lock
  - and you forget about the background story completely
- hints from a supervisor (big brother)
- little surprises -- "secret" door to another room
- it is fun but not as challenging as classic puzzlehunt game
