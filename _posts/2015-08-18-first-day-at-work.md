* I fantasized about actually working the first day.
* In reality, onboarding procedures are quite lengthy.
* I was amazed -- my first regular job, own workplace, accounts etc.
  * Despite amazement, I **should make some fuses** that I don't get into
    stereotype.
* I liked the informal atmosphere, food and bicycle room.
* I was overloaded with plethora of information.
  * Only after I got them all/complete I could decide what was important and
    what was just written and not stuck to. 
* Grandmother asked whether I have sufficient lunch meals :-)
* I won't write more, since I don't have time and I don't know what is internal
  information and what is just general observation.

*Update week after:* I understand the processes better. The more I know, the
more funny I find my curious questions from the first day.  Also my social
awkwardness is striking me down a bit, I guess. (*Update few more days later:*
better now, probably just mood fluctuations.)
