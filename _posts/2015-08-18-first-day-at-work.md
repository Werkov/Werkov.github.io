* I fantasized about actually working the first day.
* Actually, onboarding procedures are quite lengthy.
* My first regular job. I was amazed by own workplace, accounts etc.
  * Despite amazement, I **shoud make some fuses** that I don't get into
    stereotype.
* I liked the informal atmosphere, food and bicycle room.
* I was overloaded with plethora of information.
  * Only after I got them all/complete I could decide what is important and
    what is just written and not sticked to.
* Grandmother asked whether I have sufficient lunch meals :-)
* I won't write more, since I don't have time and I don't know what is internal
  information and what is just general observation.

*Update week after:* I understand the processes better. It must have been funny
when I was asking things that even I know are not so important details. Also my
social awkwardness is striking me down.
