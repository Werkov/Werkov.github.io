## Practicals

- medium comfort in Serbian sleeping carriage (with smokers)
- very slow (<40 km/h) Serbian railway (and no guarantee on (seat) reservations)
- very long waiting on (Schengen area) borders (both directions)
- European level hostel in Sofia (Hostel 123, Iskar street)
- limited supply of water while climbing Musala
  - crazy Bulgarian gifted us a bottle of water
- descent is harder than climbing (also depends on tightening the boots)
  - down to Makedonija was the worst
  - later tried sandals on grassy surfaces
- indistinctive/obsoleted marking of the hiking route on descent to Predel
- various intensity of sweating + demi/dehy effect on power and strength
- Predel 
  - hut (the janitor doesn't like Czechs and rejected us)
    - luckily, there's also a camping
  - shop by the road
- Koncheto was packed with tourists and slightly dangerous (if one was dizzy or exhausted)
- climb to Vichren (from Kutelo saddle, some technical parts with chains
  (allegedly [UIAA.I](https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vichren#V%C3%BDstup))
- long way back in luxurious bus
  - the worst road surface was between Brno and Prague (and Sofia southern ring)
- squat toilet (in most huts)
- huts are operated either by the national park or Bulgarian hiking club (tension between them)
  - recommended: Granchar, Makedonija (food only), camping Predel, Javorov, Banderitsa
  - huts to avoid: Musala hut, Ribni ezera, Predel hut


## Natural sights

- [canyon](https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%B8%D1%9B%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B0_%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0) from Serbia to "Bulgaria"
- horses 
  - in cities (workhorses)
  - in mountains (wild?)
- Musala (highest peak of Balkans)
  - up there is cold and windy
- landscape with green/brown grass and islands of dwarf pines
- many lakes (water systems in mountains?)
- picturesque sleeping by lakes above Makedonija
- relative sunset (occluded by mountains), brown mist on horizon
- sudden change from granite to lime (Rila to Pirin)
- descent to Banderitsa hut through a field of large round limestones and grass + chamois
- clouds and interesting turbulent streams (Рибни езера)
- vast grazings (border of Парангалица) with many cows (including cowpats and
  abundant flies), we even found a preserved skeleton

## Manmade sights

- seen Visegrad (from train)
- Serbian facades (none)
- Belgrade looks very poor (just neighborhood of railway station (which is
  quite small))
  - affected by migrating refugees? (Farsi/Arabic labels in park)
- Sofia
  - compact center 
  - no river in Sofia
  - orthodox church, mosque (open), synagogue (closed)
    - first time in mosque
    - tactile icons
- contrast: office buildings with cobble stone roads, housing estates,
  restaurants, wild dogs and horse-towed carriage
- Borovec, Bansko -- tourist crowded locations for skiing
- everything looks overengineered for much greater load (Musala hut, Granchar,...)
  - perhaps used earlier
  - camping in Predel
- Predel -- spring of Ivan the Tshudotvorets
- truck loaded with steel rods (looked almost empty but hardly climbed to Predel)

## People and society

- people smoke more in Balkan (cigarette ends even on mountain paths)
- contrast of EU/nonEU (nice Sofia arrival)
- Bulgarian socioeconomic situation
  - 100, 300, 500 (pension, average salary?, good salary??)
    - sorry, I forgot the context
  - EUR/month
- Bulgarian symbol of lion (church, currency)
- not many marks of Turkish influence (cf. Czechia and Austria-Hungary)
- buses scaled to traffic (marshrootka?)
- meeting Czechs
  - experienced Alda
  - sharing experience
    - shoes
    - food (travel lunch)
    - maps
    - canyoning
  - Czech scouts, German group/tourists
- meeting Bulgarians
  - silent guide and his band
  - talkative attractive ecologist girl
  - sisters at Granchar hut
- low morale in misty/cold morning + sudden change after clearing the clouds
  - it's actually same in real life
- Bulgarian nodding (it's inverse!)
- Predel pronunciation
- animals at Javorov hut
  - cat, fox, hunter dogs (poacher dogs?)

## Food

- [traditional]({% post_url 2016-08-03-tdah %}#day-03-2016-07-27) gyros in Budapest
- extra large tomatoes
- Schopska salad, bean soup

## Equipment

- new boots served well
- backpack with nominal 65 l (really 50--60 l) was crammed (hard to search in it)

## Lessons learnt

- protect forehead against sun (cap+scarf)

## Random thoughts

- distorted estimate of inclination
