## Content

### Curvature of spaces
- [The Lady of Shalott](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Maw_Egley)
  - can only see thing through a mirror
- Riemann Hypothesis
  - relation to prime numbers
  - and also eigenvector of matrix describing large atoms (similar with [bus drivers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/nlin/0001015.pdf))
  - in practice it's true (not proof, cf physics, economics (joke))
- how to become famous mathematician
  - prove great theorem
  - find great problem
  - find great concepts
    - Riemannian geometry
    - curvature
- hyperbolic stitching
  - constant negative curvature
- Poincaré: the art of giving same name to different things
- Ricci curvature (cf general relativity)

## Slow mastering of chance

- Boltzmann
  - sect of people visiting Boltzmann's grave
  - connection to statistics
- Bernoulli
  - law of large numbers
- Abraham de Moivre
  - exp(-x* *2)
- Buffon's needle
- Laplace
  - the Law of Errors
- Adolphe Quetelet -- popularized law of random causes
- Francis Galton (if Greeks had known that law, they'd have personified it)
- Claude Channon
  - draft: information or uncertainty
  - rework by von Neumann: entropy
- entropy
  - number of combinations is out of this world, so logarithmize it
  - vacuum doesn't suck, it's power of statistics
  - "Disorder and information is better than order and disinformation" (about a
    broadcasting company)
- partial differential equations
  - Navier-Stokes equations are popular in Holywood industry
- maximum entropy -- law of errors
  - a Boltzmann's equation for homogenous gas (is not homogenous)


### Optimization problems
- Cercignani Conjecture
  - Toscani, Villani
  - "Simple to state, difficult to prove. As you like it."
  - this idea was completely naïve and could never work but he found an
    interesting identity
- Leonid Kantorovich
  - very real-life problems (A-bomb, taxi fares, Petrograd siege)
  - book: The best uses of economic resources
  - operational research, plywood
    - linear programming used to be in French high school curriculum
  - Monge-Kantorovich
    - min-max flow theorem?
    - the theorem looks like maximization of capitalistic profit

### Synthesis
- conclusion of topics
  - prices (optimization)
  - shapes of triangles (geometry)
  - entropy (statistics)
- coworkers
  - Felix Otto, John Lott
  - visiting in USA, no duties, just going to lunch and socialize -- it cost
    him fortune
- the lazy gas experiment
  - initial and final state of gas
  - optimize the way it transitions
  - similar to movement in curved space
- Optimal transport, old and new (1000 pages book by him)
- new theorem every month
- importance of random encounters for research

## Meta
- sponsored by K. Janeček
- LibreOffice on MacOS
- use of French quotes in presentation
- Hilbert pronunciation [ilbert]
- Bolzano Lectures series (not in France)
  - Bičák boasts about Bolzano
  - how Bolzano read Euclid's Foundations and was cured
  - also A. Lincoln read Euclides
