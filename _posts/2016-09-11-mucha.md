## The band

  - the band consists of four people: two guitar players, one drummer and
    the singer (Nikola Muchová, she's the most prominent)
  - they started late
  - she stylizes herself into role of a mother (Mama Mucha)
    - breast-feeding references
    - response to passing ambulance: "You're gonna wake my baby!"
  - also reminds train as traveling means
    - dedication of song to vomitting boy in the train
    - referencing their journey
  - she seems gaining weight in comparison what I saw on the internets (old videos)
  - taking photo of audience for her grandmother

## Songs

  - most of them I had already known
  - some new
    - Nána, Romka, Pan Píča, Pozdě se zamilovat, over-eating, Za
      všechno může matka, Heil Hispter, Slovenský pop
  - some were with no deeper idea, just shocking (Pan Píča)
    - thanks to that she won't be too mainstream
  - again combining languages
    - English, German, Slovak

## Audience

  - group of gipsies (curiosity)
  - heavy (i.e. loads of iron) punker (only one)
  - teenagers (50 %)
  - people around my age (40 %)
    - mixed weed smokers, bad language speakers, also some "burgeois" like me
    - smokers all around
  - even some older people (10 %)
  - people mostly in groups (couples or groups of friends)
  - people close to stage danced wildly (~pogo)
  - other people swang from side to side or moved their heads rhythmically

## My behavior

  - I thought I'd repay all the pirate copies I downloaded, unfortunately
    the concert was free -- I wonder who paid it
  - I was lucky to keep my invariant of not visiting the Cross Club -- it
    was on the outdoor premises only
  - I stood all the time, held cup of lemonade and I was thinking --
    taking the lyrics into account too 
  - later I also had "urge" to rhythmically move (e.g. clap with foot)
    and I resisted :-)

## General

  - volume too high, my hearing perception was distorted (due to non-linearity)
    - and tinnitus afterwards
