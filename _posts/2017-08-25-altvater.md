## Day 0 (Dlouhé Stráně)

- base in Kouty nad Desnou (~556 m)
- relatively easy (continuous) climb up to ~1348 m
- meeting plethora of kick-scooter riders and few cyclists going down (some of
  them weren't even wearing a helmet)
- interesting
  - upper reservoir isn't a clearly cut mountain but part of it is a gravity
    wall from the mined material
  - the two reservoirs are connect with an underground staircase (seen just
    maintenance entries)
  - inner walls are quite steep (~30°) and sound of waves reminds seaside
- trivial downhill (thanks to restricted traffic in the natural
  reservation/powerplant premises)

## Day 1 (Praděd)

- start in Lipová-Lázně (~406 m), 11:00
- reaching the top after ~1400 climbed meters, many pauses and a hiking detour at 17:00
- having a soup in the hotel restaurant (which conserved the 80s look)
- downhill via asphalt route (Ovčárna, Karlova Studánka,..., Lipová-Lázně)
  - max speed 65.25 km/h
  - overall distance: 80.39 km
  - riding time: 5:23:19 (average speed 14.91 km/h)

## Day 2 (Olomouc)

- also cave Na Pomezí
- Velké Losiny spa
- Olomouc
  - many churches, palaces and former fortification
  - appearance of richer history than Brno
