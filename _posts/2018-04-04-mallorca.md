## Practicals

* Ryanair has hard seats (and no vomit bags), Wizzair is softer (and thus bags); leg space is borderline in both
* path marking
  * red+white band is the main color
  * signposts (small (column), big (pointers))
  * barriers (twigs, stones)
    * took us some time until we learnt leveraging those
  * drawings: arrows, red circles
* possible to sleep without tent
* Bellver areal closes in the night (~21:30)
* Kiwi.com
  * necessary to reclaim & checkin our baggage during transfer in Bergamo
  * they messed check-in for our last flight -> we had to pay the fee of 35€ for airport checking
  * kudos to them how easily we could file a complaint online and how smoothly they reimbursed us
* water
  * generally no problems (March/April)
  * south of Soller there were enough opportunities in towns and villages
  * north of Soller there war also springs and public pipes
* total cost (travel, food, accommodation) ~ 350 EUR

## Natural sights

* gusts of wind
  * calm periods interrupted with gusts that gradually increased in intensity (~10 seconds) and then faded out
* no dew
* torrent de Pareis gorge
* cacti, succulents and palms both in gardens and in the wild

## Manmade sights

* terraced gardens (olive trees)
* deserted houses/huts
* lemon and orange tree orchards
* charcoal kiln platforms (signs of earlier times economy)
* frequent graffiti of Antifa Stuttgart
  * the drawings are quite contrasting in native(?) rural areas
* interesting generalization of statistics
  * mean minimizes sum of deviation squares (2)
  * median minimizes sum of absolute deviations (1)
  * modus minimizes sum of zeroth power of deviations (0, where $0^0 := 0$)
  * *that's why I like travelling with STEM folks*
* underground bus and train terminal in Palma de Mallorca (Plaça d'Espanya)
* nonsensical(?) stony barriers/walls (in the mountains)
