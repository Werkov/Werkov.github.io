## Motivation

When I was about to start working fulltime, I knew it'd be great change in my
life and it'd be useful to dump my thought before this change, so that I'd have
a reference for comparison with my newly discovered ideas, thought and
opinions.

I was in [culture shock][1], fortunately, it was not the first time -- it
already happened when I started studying at the university and in some scale
also when I went from the primary school to the grammar school.
So I wasn't that shocked in the end, I just wondered how much things can be
different.

Expecting the changes to come, I summarized my ideas into few points that I
call The Declaration of Progression. (I write this post few months after the
transition. Fortunately, I wrote down the most important ideas so the
comparison would be still valid.)

## The Declaration of Progression

  1. Do not dwell in stereotypes/routines.
   * Unless they make you more effective. However, avoid being lazy to find new
     approaches.
  2. Don't make work a *single* source of joy/meaning of life.
   * Single point of failure (may cause disappointment). Make it diverse.
  3. Keep being frictionless.
   * That's similar to no stereotypes.
   * Don't stuck in local optima, optimize (move there without friction).
   * Practically, it means limitation both of mental and physical bonds.
  4. Train/nurture your old skills.
   * Other programming languages, problem solving, mathematics, design and
     architecture of systems (i.e. actively develop), Coursera.
  5. Review your alternative paths (did become the alternative better after
     some event/time?).
   * Alternative 1: Go study PhD in Prague.
   * Alternative 2: Go study PhD abroad.
   * Alternative 3: Join (base?) a startup company.
   * Alternative 4: Cycle around the world.
  6. Review this document (at least once a year).
   * So that it is effective and not just a piece of crazy thoughts.

## Further notes on the culture shock

  * Maybe having a family and children is the only thing you can do after
    graduation not get bored.
    * OTOH, it's a shallow achievement compared with science discoveries,
      bootstraping a successfull project (whatever it is), being a dictator
      etc.
  * Expect to [have less and less free-/open-minded friends][2] (like you) since they settle and
    you have to adapt as well.
