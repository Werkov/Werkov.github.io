## Practicals

- train is extra slow after Czechowitz
  - the difference was visible (slower, worse track lead, dismantled infrastructure)
- center to Wieliczka transport
  - public transport by bus 304, near Matějko platz and Galeria
  - may be crowded in the season
- there are limitations on size of backpacks allowed into the Wieliczka mine
- better preorder online to skip one (of two) queues
- it was 25--26°C and it was uncomfortable
- language
  - learnt Polish pronunciation [krakúv]
  - inverted adjective ordering
  - beware confusion with Czech (same words different meanings: droga, kwieten)
- disorganized railway station
  - 1) there's the old one which is a museum
  - 2) the new one is multilevel hall
- survived without any Polish cash

## Natural sights

- the Vistula river (a turn near the city center)
- salt underground
- mountains in the distance (High Tatras?)

## Manmade sights

- Wieliczka
  - super crowded, my bag passed, 
  - decided for the tourist route (with all the well-known exhibits)
  - all cavities are artificial :-o
    - there is underground complex with toillets, restaurant, cinema, lecture
      hall, shops, mobile signal etc.
    - to work in mine has total different meaning
    - 400 (or 600) years old
  - licking :-/
  - the bus on the way back was even more crowded

- Wawel
  - doesn't look so big from distance
  - but getting there from river is quite a climb and the areal is surprisingly vast
    - several stages, top stage is cathedral and the castle (and multiple other houses)
    - fake grave of Friderick Chopin (Paris Pére Lachiase)
    - true Adam Mickiewitz

- Jewish quarter
  - I've never seen so many synagogues (closed)
  - streets are wide and well-organized, the houses are low though (2--3 floors only)
  - interesting Nowy platz with the Roundhouse
  - it's the more hipster region

## People

- they actually use the churches (Sunday evening)
- no Vietnamese groceries
- Karol Wojtyla is a pop idol
- Generali Asia meetup/team building
  - I've never seen a group of so many bad clothed people
- European Salesian Youth meetup (or Silesian)
- well-looking girls pair with well-looking guys (groomed)
- electromobile tours in the center
- Jehova Witnesses recruiters
- most of the roommates were solo travellers (and the rest were couples)
- a Newzealander who is backpacking Europe (quit job, cooks lunches in hostels to save money for the travel)
- using women or even girls as decoy
  - horse carriages
  - segways
  - boat cruises (funny moment when she had sunburnt front legs as she was standing there whole morning)

## Food

- Mlieczny bar
  - local cuisine, cheap and tasty (žurek, kluski sleskie s pecziarkami)

## Day 01

- many Germans, some Poles, not majority of Czechs in the train
  - and Frenchs with crying baby right behing me!
- display above the seat showed reservations on my neighbours but ~2 minutes before scheduled departure (we were 3 minutes delayed in reality)
  - but my place showed still as reserved
  - are there sensors? did they cancel it?
- the train almost emptied until reaching borders (Bohumín is engine change)

- historical center
- old Russian ladies (I thought they were maids)

## Day 02

- antiobservation of early waking Asians
- the most expensive apple in my life (300g for price of 1 kg)
- main sightseeing day

## Day 03

- morning run

- group of Americans eurotripping
  - noisy, making list of cities in US to visit
