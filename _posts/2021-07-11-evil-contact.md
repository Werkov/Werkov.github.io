The game of contact is for at least three player.
The player A thinks about a word and reveals its first letter.
At least two other players p1 and p2 have to be in so called *contact*.
Let's say player p1 describes a word starting with the revealed letter.
If player A guesses what the described word is, they can say: "No, it is not *word*".
In the rare case the description matched the A's secret word, the player A loses (and pi win).
If player p2 has an idea about the secret word, they announce it by claiming
"Contact" and counting to 3 (that's opportunity for A to intervene). 
After the countup p1 and p2 say the alleged secret word out loud.
If they say the same word, player A has to reveal one more letter from their
secret word and it continues in analogous way.
