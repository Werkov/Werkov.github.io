* cross-country skiing + sledging
* 37 km/day (in the beginning) @ 7.5 km/h
* crevasses
* hard breathing at 8000 feet above sea level (their measurement)
  * turning around in sleeping bag
* singularity in polar conditions
  * they still talked about noon, assuming their meridian
* marking everything with "South Pole" to serve as souvenirs later
* leaving Polheim
  * what would be my thoughts at such a moment? if this is the pole , how many peope will come after us? what if we missed the pole ?
* daily schedule on way back
  * "we were to do our fifteen geographical miles, or twenty-eight kilometres,
    and then have a sleep of six hours, turn out again and do fifteen miles
    more, and so on."
* depot logistcs
  * large depot at 80°
* there was much to do in Framheim during winter (sewing (tents, adjustments),
  woodworks (sledges), maintenance)

* no easy navigation (maps weren't complete)
* the other party was supposed to "carry out what exploration time and circumstances might permit" in King Edwards land
* temperature close to freezing point are worse because tent floors are wet
  * the temperatures ranged from -50°C to ~0°C
  * rain never, sleet once
  * snowfall never in still wind
* Japanese doing research (whaling?)
* ex-post report recalculates that: "(first polar) station lies between lat. 89º 52' and 89º 56' S., and between long. 90º and 120º E."
* probable position of Polheim may be given roughly as lat. 89º 58.5' S., and long. 60º E.

### Language & style

Animals aren't humans and humans are carnivores:

> ...big Emperor penguin, making bow after bow. It gave exactly the impression
> of having come up simply to pay us its respects. We were sorry to repay its
> attention so poorly, but such is the way of the world. With a final bow it
> ended its days in the frying-pan.

> came a crab-eater, shining like silver in the sun. He came right up, was
> photographed, and -- shot.

> "An Emperor penguin just come on a visit -- soup-kettle." He did not get a
> very long epitaph.

Environment reference
> as they say, you never know what the day is like before sunset.

Bitterness
> the pleasure of standing out there in rather light attire had not exactly put
> warmth into our bodies.

Joking (on the vessel during sail)
> first, I came by and told him that it was blowing a hurricane if he cared to
> see what it looked like. 'Oh, yes,' he said, 'I could guess it was blowing, for
> the galley fire has never drawn so well;

* they employed *bitches*
* intermezzo with a 3rd person visiting the hut
