Pub quiz *Hospodský kvíz* categorized their results into [various topics](https://www.hospodskykviz.cz/tematicke-ligy/).

Those topics are:

	 1	aktualitova		news
	 2	filmova			movies
	 3	historicka		history
	 4	hrava			puzzles
	 5	kulturni		culture
	 6	obrazkova		pictures
	 7	poslechova		listening
	 8	prirodovedecka		natural science
	 9	spolecenska		society
	10	sportovni		sport
	11	vedecko-technicka	sci-tech
	12	zemepisna		geography

The results of individual teams can be represented as [a
matrix](https://gist.github.com/Werkov/831ad3fed7fac5b6da386c67ba54edd7) where
each row is one team and each column is a topic according to the list above.

Not all teams took part on all contests (and not all contests presented all
topics), so the missing results are filled with zeros for the purposes of the
statistics.

*Figure 1* Mean and standard deviations per topic. Note that some topics were
presented less frequently, so their appear as more difficult (I don't have data
for normalization).

*Figure 2* Topic correlations. Interesting are weak correlations of
puzzle-history, society-history and puzzle-sport. This may be affected by
"cohabitation" of some topics more often than others.

principal components, weights of them are in in Figure 4).

*Figure 4* PCA weights, we can see there is no much differentiation. Teams are
mostly spread along one axis -- overall skill of a team.
