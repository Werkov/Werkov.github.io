title: Should I move this "blog"?
---

Update 2015-08-02: [I moved]({% post_url 2015-07-30-welcome-to-jekyll %}).

Recently, idea of using statically generated blog hosted on Github pages became
quite appealing to me. Still I'm hesitating whether it's worth moving from
Dokuwiki.

## Reasons for Dokuwiki 
  * more user-friendly editor (not sure, think about Vim)
  * better integration with web (easier inclusion of figures)
  * preview feature
  * I already have some content -- cost of migration
  * effectively static pages too (it's cached)
  * easy to set up write access for BFUs (not only instead of comments)
  * accessible revisions/history (could be achieved with raw access to Git too)
  * neg: difficult creation of new posts (create link to it, the page and the
    title in the page)
  * neg: cannot stay on this university hosting

## Reasons for git + page generator 
  * free/reliable hosting at Github or anywhere else
  * offline editing of posts
  * can move/archive whole blog anywhere as a Git repository
  * smaller attack vector (they're static pages)
  * neg: necessity to fill commit log messages


## Generally good features 
  * history of edits, possibility to "develop" posts
  * neg?: lack of comments/remarks (either third party or plugin)
