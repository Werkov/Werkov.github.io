*This summary for me. Don't rely on it, the information here may get outdated.*

Most probable troubles:

  * car accident
  * old/ill person collapse (heart attack, diabetes)
  * injury during sports/outdoor activity

### 1. Danger 
  * protect yourself

### 2. Response/rescue
  * call, shake
  * unconsciousness -> call help

### 3. Airways
  * tilt head backwards, open mouth

### 4. Breathing
  * reliable breathing (not gasping)

### 5. Circulation
  * Stain Alive rhythm, 100--120 bpm, >5 cm amplitude
  * no breathing in
  * keep cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until handover to professionals
  * risk of CPRing "healthy" person is low, so start always


## Remote help

  * call 155 in the Czech Republic (directly)
  * call 112 in other European countries (don't call this in CR, it's one more hop)
  * tip: install a smartphone app as an assistant in case of no signal or a guide


## Injuries (TODO)

  * pressure bandage
  * splint
