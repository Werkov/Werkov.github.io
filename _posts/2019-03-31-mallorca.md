## Diary

  * [GPS track](/resources/2019-mallorca.gpx)
  * see also [Mallorca hiking trip]({% post_url 2018-04-04-mallorca %})

### Day 00 (2019-03-27)

  * **daily stats:** 1500 km by airliner
  * **sleeping:** Palma, [hostel](https://wehostelpalma.com/)
  * early wake up at 4:00 (going to bed at 1:00), sleeping on the train to Vienna
  * free afternoon in Palma, not many people out (siesta)
  * hour long nap to replenish energy and reduce headache due to sleep deficit
  * doubts about plan: Sollér, Sa Calobra?, Lluc

### Day 01 (2019-03-28)

  * **daily stats:** 65 km, +1931 m, -1452 m
  * **sleeping:** nearby Lluc monastery
  * very slow morning because [bike rental](https://nanobicycles.com/) opens
    only at 10:00
  * can't use my payment card for the reservation
    * the cause was limit on internet payments that the rental used
    * phoned the bank to adjust the limit
    * the rest went smoothly
  * ad hoc changing to cycling clothes in a park and learning how to handle the
    road bicycle (especially gear down)
  * well-marked cycling path got me out of the city
  * meeting the first cyclists, they're obvious pros
  * lunch in Sollér, the main square is full of people, the waiters have to
    watch out for the tram and the tram passengers are litteraly few decimeters
    above my plate
  * the main climb of the day/trip to the tunnel Son Torrella
    * the continuous flow of cyclists is like a race, I can beat only a German
      retired couple
    * quick pass around the lakes and dams on the top
    * downhill is quite chilly
  * no energy and time to descent to (and ascent from) Sa Calobra
  * arrival to Lluc monastery, it is emptier than I expected (later people come
    out, they are accomodated there)

### Day 02 (2019-03-29)

  * **daily stats:** 113 km, +769 m, -1091 m
  * **sleeping:** fields near Porreres
  * surprised by pain of outer calves and my posterior after getting up	(~8:00)
  * descent to Inca (visiting patieseria, refiling water)
  * journey to Manacor
    * flat terrain but windy (hooked a pro upon arrival to Manacor)
    * every pothole hurts (my butt)
  * poorer/unreconstructed suburbs of Manacor got me to the historical center
    with narrow streets
    * smaller towns ~ less Germans, more minorities ?
  * big road to Portocristo, big traffic
  * afternoon break and relax (drying sleeping bag) by the sea in Portocristo
    (~1 hour)
  * road to Felinatx (along sea) is surprisingly hilly
  * necessary shopping due to minerals (salt) deficiency
  * evening ride is easier, harder looking for a sleeping place (many lands are
    private)

### Day 03 (2019-03-30)

  * **daily stats:** 116 km, +954 m, -1104 m
  * **sleeping:** Palma, [hostel](https://wehostelpalma.com/)
  * early wake up (7:15), early depart to Puig de Randa (8:15, summit 9:30)
    * I was not the first (tires of cyclists at Mallorca make humming sound
      even at climb)
  * quick downhill to Llucmajor, returing in a group of cyclist who headed to
    Puig de Randa, I continued to Algaida
  * Algaida--Santa Maria was the quickest part (tail wind + energy)
    * Santa Maria is crowded cycling crossroad
    * continued to Bunyoala with same pace but then had to refill fuel
      (trembling members)
  * repeated climb to Coll du Sollér (the training paid off, I outpaced a cyclist)
  * tiring downhill/flat arrival to Palma
  * sugar refill at the coast and because I still had the time before returning
    the bike a cycled the coastal cycling path
    * tourist hell (hotels, beaches, shops)
    * unexperienced e-bikes riders in narrow turns

### Day 04 (2019-03-31)

  * **daily stats:** 5 km, +342 m, -342 m (walking),
    1500 km by airliner,
    8 km (city walking)
  * **sleeping:** buses Vienna--Brno--Prague
  * no particular plan for the day
  * ad hoc trip to Pollença
    * climb to Puig de Maria
    * the path so crowded I had no privacy to pee
  * weather turned bad just when I was leaving Pollença
  * I looked for a bakery at the airport so I had to walk against the crowds in
    the corridors, it felt unconsciously a bit uneasy


## Natural sights

  * various puigs

## Practicals

  * for quick security check, get ahead of the crowds from the airport train 
  * low-cost baggage and travelling light
  * ~25 minutes from landing to bus stand in Vienna (when everything goes smooth)
  * cycling path(s) in Palma
    * distinctive red color (the road)
    * sometimes the track goes in opposite of traffic (left side)
    * complicated turning left (you have to cross path of cars going in
      parallel with you)
  * abundant infrastructure for road cyclists everywhere


## Manmade sights

  * [Puig de Randa monastery](https://ca.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santuari_de_Cura)
  * quarry near Sineu
  * [Gemeindewohnungen in Vienna](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemeindebau)

## People

  * Slovak girl who travels alone and rents a car (flight neighbor)
  * group of Moravian cyclist (~50 years old) on the plane
  * Spaniards
    * they wear apparently winter clothes at ~12°C
  * contrasts
    * a tourist girl with black lipstick and unshaved legs vs road cyclists
      with shaved legs
  * bike mechanic girl doing maintenance of a bike (changing chain?) in
    gloves (cf a mechanic guy with dirty hands in Czech workshops), clean and
    professional
  * artists accomodated in Randa
  * no fat old people
  * kitchen in restaurant opens at 19:30
  * [Max Hürzeler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_H%C3%BCrzeler)
  * cyclist stratification
    * 0--50 m: tourists, e-bikes, city bikes
    * 50--150 m: hobby cyclists, families
    * 150--1000 m: true road cyclists
  * many sunburnt faces on the plane back


## Food

    * bought iron reserve in the evening
    * pizza Mallorquina on day 00
  * day 01
    * breakfast in hostel

## Lessons learnt

  * buffers for transfers (2.5 hours outbound was enough, 0.5 hour inbound did
    not suffice)

  * account for low-cost airline delays, 
  * train delays, buffer for transfers
  * Wien Hauptbahnhof is closed between 1:30 and 4:00 (and no trains in that window)
  * trip joy depends on number of participants

[![Dependency of joy on number of participants of a trip](/resources/2019-group-joy.png)](/resources/2019-group-joy.png)

  * it is possible to do the shopping alone in small groceries
  * it is possible to do the cycling vacation with lightly sore throat
  * it is possible to go to number 2 when cycling alone
  * training tips
    * at 5% climb, interleave 5 minutes light gear and 5 minutes off-seat pedalling
  * riding with backpack bruises where vertebrae are bulging 
  * prepare program for a day if departure is in the evening
