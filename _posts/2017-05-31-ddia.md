Reading period: Feb 2017--May 2017

Designing Data-Intensive Applications. Martin Kleppmann. O'Reilly 2017 (preprint version)

- a gift from O'Reilly at FOSDEM 2017
- like Distributed Systems by Tannenbaum but with more real-world examples and
  application explanation


## Brief notes

- startups
  - quick iteration of features (rather than scalability)

- document databases
  - XML, JSON
  - lack joins, encourage denormalization

- log based structures
  - **TODO** LSMÂ trees
  - append only, databases

- OLTP vs OLAP (transactions vs analytics)
  - kingdom of RDBMSs

- RPC
  - design flaw that tris to hide inherent drawbacks of network (unreliability, latency, repeated delivery)
  - SOAP (reliance on scaffolders, API generators)

- "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled." by Feynman

- mobile clients -- extreme of distributed systems
  - "As the rich history of broken calendar sync implementations demonstrates,
    multi-leader replication is a tricky thing to get right."
  - work in disconnected mode (very long latency)

- **TODO** stages of consistency
  - total ordering
  - causal ordering
  - reading your writes
  - transactions 
    - multi-version concurrency control (MVCC), snapshots
      - writers never block readers and vice versa
    - still write skew (FoL, room booking)
      - airlines and their overbooking policies (if it's economic your data needn't be consistent)
    - 2 phase locking vs 2 phase commit
    - SSI (serializable snapshot isolation) -- new kid on the block
  - strong consistency
  - relation to distributed consensus problem
    - various assumptions (e.g. availability of random numbers)
    - most algorithms assume a single node can process all data (should it be necessary)

- end-to-end constraints
  - request ID to eliminate write skew(?)

- immutability FTW
  - except for data retention regulations
    - moral aspects of data processing (data = exhaust (cf. environmentalism) , s/data/surveillance/)
    - asymmetric relation between a user and service (cf. employee and employer)
      - social cost of not using social networking service

- skewed workload
  - followers of Justin Bieber on Twitter

- partitioning and scalability
  - initially there is only a single partition (with little data) but it's a potential bottleneck

- system model
  - assumptions one has to take about system to provide guarantees

- absolute time is a luxury
  - even each CPU can have different time
  - drift
  - APIs (Google Spanner) that work with confidence intervals
  - problem with finite windows (e.g. collecting events)

- difference between computer science and software engineering
  - "a real implementation may still have to include code to handle the case
    where something happens that was assumed to be impossible"

- tools/systems integration
  - Unix philosophy (utilities + pipes)
  - idea of piping e-mail account and shopping history to a data analytics tool
  - convergence of Map-Reduce and stored procedures in RDBMS (MPP?)
  - stream processing (dual problem to RDBMS -- static query, ephemeral data)

- "People often specialize in one particular niche of technology, and remain unaware of the requirements that exist in other niches."

- beginnings of web/distributed applications
  - the state: page could only scroll up and down
