====== Customizing Android phone ======

===== Obtaining root access =====

  * requested unlock key on Sony website
  * backed up data
  * found out precise version of firmware/software
  * installed ''android-tools-adb'' and ''android-tools-fastboot''
  * unlocked bootloader ''fastboot -i 0x0fce oem unlock 0x2C...21'' (erased user data)
    * may be it was unnecessary
  * then I downloaded [[http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1886460|Bin4ry utility]] for rooting
  * changed executable permission on ''stuff/*'' files
